Here is a review of [Day 1](http://blog.theautomatedtester.co.uk/2008/10/gtac-2008-day-1.html) and [Day 2](http://blog.theautomatedtester.co.uk/2008/10/gtac-2008-day-2.html) from another attendee of the Google Test Automation Conference. I'll follow with my thoughts related to ColdFusion after I finish tranferring two sessions into Google Docs and a Debugging presentation, I am giving @ the NECFUG this Tues. My notes of the GTAC 2008 sessions can be found [here](http://mikehenke.com/machblog//index.cfm?event=showEntry&entryId=26B0FBAB-19B9-BA51-EE1CE5E1BBCB72A4).
