I see Jim Priest wrote "[Code ColdFusion applications fast with the Eclipse CFEclipse plug-in](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-eclipse-cfeclipse/index.html?ca=drs-tp4507)". The article was released in IBM's developerWorks Open source section. Looks like a must read. I printed it off to take home :-)
