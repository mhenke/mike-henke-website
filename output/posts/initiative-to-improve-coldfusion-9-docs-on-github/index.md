This post in named similiarly to Ray Camden's recent post, [Initiative to improve ColdFusion docs](http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2011/6/28/Initiative-to-improve-ColdFusion-docs). If you haven't read the post, please do. I support the initiative and want to take contributing to everyone not only Adobe with members of the ColdFusion community. With this goal, I have started a [github repository for "Developing ColdFusion 9 Applications"](https://github.com/mhenke/Developing-ColdFusion-9-Applications). Using Github to store the guide allows a simple click to fix a typo or improve an example within the browser. I am still working on a solution to take the DCF9A pdf and converting into markdown or some other format for [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) to convert to markdown. With markdown as the base, the files can be convert to pdf, html, epub, etc with pandoc.
