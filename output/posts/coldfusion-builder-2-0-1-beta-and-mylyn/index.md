There was a tweet by [lolajl](https://twitter.com/#!/lolajl) about frustrations with installing [Mylyn](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/) on the CFBuilder2.0.1 beta. My recommendation was to skip trying the standalone then adding Mylyn. I would use [Eclipse](http://eclipse.org), then add CFB as a plugin. Below are the steps, I ran through when i installed CFB on Windows. 1) Download

- [ColdFusion Builder 2.0.1 beta](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion10/#coldfusion_builder)
- [Eclipse Indigo (3.7.1)](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) - Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers- 64bit windows

3) Start cfb installer, "run as administrator"

- next
- accept, next
- ColdFusion Builder plugins within Eclipse, next
- next
- this will be different, depending on your eclipse folder location, mine was C:\\Users\\Scott\\Desktop\\eclipse
- finish up wizard

  
noting the time to install cfb from starting installer to installation complete: 2 minutes 54 seconds  
  
4) Start Eclipse, C:\\Users\\Scott\\Desktop\\eclipse\\eclipse.exe, open  
  
first time opening eclipse, so select a workspace. this is where eclipse data is stored like projects.  
  
\- C:\\Users\\Scott\\workspace  
  
check use this as the default, ok ![](images/cfbb2.jpg)  
  
arrange, views ![](images/cfbb3.jpg) Â  and create new project. C:\\Users\\Scott\\workspace\\testing  
![](images/cfbb4.jpg) 5) lets grab some cfml files from github for testing CFB. using [fw1](https://github.com/seancorfield/fw1) since it is the most watched ColdFusion project.  
copy to project location (notice my project isn't linked to a cf server, this is just for testing cfb) ![](images/cfbb5.jpg) Refresh project in eclipse, open Application.cfc ![](images/cfbb6.jpg)  
adding mylyn views to ColdFusion perspective  
  
ctrl-3 - type "mylyn" in the quick access window ![](images/cfbb7.jpg)  
  
select the three views, had to individual, couldn't highlight all three at once.  
  
throws them somewhere, mine was lower right. ![](images/cfbb8.jpg)  
  
once you have the perspective, setup how you like it, i recommend saving it as myXXXX so you can reset it easily.  
  
  
Missing ColdFusion Perspective?  
control-3 then type in coldfusion ![](images/cfbb9.jpg)
