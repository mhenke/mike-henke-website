I feel like I am in Battlestar Galactica when using [Mylyn](http://eclipse.org/mylyn) to work inside Eclipse. Task focused user interface is the future and the future is now. If you are using [CFEclipse](http://cfeclipse.org/), you need to use Mylyn by creating local tasks. I have hooked in [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) and [Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) @ work but the neat thing with Mylyn is you don't need to connect your ticket and code repositories. I have watched the [Mylyn 2.2 Adobe Connect presentation](http://live.eclipse.org/node/412), five times now and pick up multiple cool things each time.  
  
**Mylyn reduces the IDE information overload. _Program more_ and search, scroll, navigate less.** _\*\*Update 4/6/2008\*\*_ _A comment was left on [dzone.com](http://www.dzone.com/links/mylyn_rocks_mylyn_rocks.html) about this post so I try to add more detail but please check out the Mylyn links above and watch the presentation. This post wasn't meant as a tutorial just my announcement how much Mylyn Rocks :-)_

- **no source control/ticket repository Mylyn still beneficial**
    - degree of interest weighting - meaning when working on a ticket you see only the relevent resources which are put into levels (landmark, interesting, uninteresting)
    - makes multitasking easy since you can pick up exactly where you left off with one click
    - focused workweek - even your task list maybe come overloaded so this helps so only the relevent tasks show
    - scheduled - soft events, own work week, planned start dates
- **connection with source control/ticket repository**
    - task context sharing - easily attach / retreive task content from tickets so anyone will be able to pickup with the relevent files
    - work with tickets inside Eclipse - no need to go to ticket system for updates and modification of tickets.
    - offline support - work with tickets is stored until synchronization so you can update tickets offline
