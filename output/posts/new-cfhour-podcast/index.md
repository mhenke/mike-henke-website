I stumbled apon [CFHour()](http://www.cfhour.com/) podcast through iTunes. They pushed a new show out yesterday. It is about integrating ColdFusion with other Adobe products along with another topic, database design. I am listening to it now. It is great to have another current ColdFusion podcast series. Keep up the great work guys!!!
