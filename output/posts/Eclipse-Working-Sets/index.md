This entry is a quick review of Working Sets in Eclipse. I will show how to create a new working set and selecting/deselecting. _Working sets help reduce the clutter._ A working set groups resources for display in the Navigator view.  
  
I finally learned about working sets today while attending a 4 day Model Glue class by Doug Hughes. Doug showed the group during a break and I figured this would complement the entry on [Eclipse Navigator Toolbar](http://mikehenke.com/machblog/index.cfm?event=showEntry&entryId=D6C41396-188B-4E84-1576FB07A9393746).

### Create A working set

Select the menu triangle in the Navigator view, then "Select Working Set..."

In the next dialog box select _New_ then _Resource_ and _Next_.

Here is where the cool part starts. Enter a name for the Working set and then select resources to be used in this working set. You are able to choice **projects,** **folder,** and **individual files**. I selected several different items.

Now you will be presented with a window to select the working set you would like activated in your Naviator Toolbar. Check your newly created working set. You can even select multiple work sets.

### Selecting/Deselecting

To deselect working sets, select working sets, and other options, you can select the menu triangle in the Navigator view.
