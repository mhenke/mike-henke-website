I hear the word **zealotry** used and for me it has a **negative** connotation. It has been brought up lately usually around something perceived as _new_ but that doesn't mean something _old_ could have zealotry.

## _I would like to see more zealotry in ColdFusion._

I thought it would be nice to break-down the definition of "zealotry" using [dictionary.reference.com](http://dictionary.reference.com).

- [zeal·ot·ry](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zealotry) - **_undue_** or **excessive** **zeal**; fanaticism.
- [un·due](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/undue)
    - unwarranted; **_excessive_**: undue haste.
    - inappropriate; **_unjustifiable_**; improper: undue influence.
- [ex·ces·sive](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/excessive) - **_going beyond the usual_**, necessary, or proper limit or degree; characterized by excess.
- [zeal](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/zeal) - fervor for a person, cause, or object; **_eager desire_** or endeavor; **_enthusiastic_ _diligence_**; ardor.

With this break-down, my preceived negatives are "_excessive_" and "_undo_". _**Undue**_ could be **negative** for me since it is "_unjustifiable_" but I wonder how many of the "zealotry" claims lately are truly on an **unjustifiable** statement. **_Excessive_** may not be **negative** depending on what a person considers "_going beyond the usual_".

- Is reading a programming book "excessive"?
- Is blogging "excessive"?
- Is presenting on a subject "excessive"?
- Is working on an open source project "excessive"?

Sadly, i would say "Yes" these are **excessive**. These are "_going beyond the usual_". Are these **negative**? No. Next time, when I hear **zealotry** used, I'll try to keep this in mind. _Was the zealotry claim on some "**unjustifiable**" statement?_ In most cases, I doubt the actual instance called _zealtory_ was _"_unjustifiable_"_ so it isn't negative but a **positive** case of zealotry. In this post's context, I think ColdFusion needs more **zealots** which means "**going beyond the usual**" with "**enthusiastic diligence**" using CFML.
