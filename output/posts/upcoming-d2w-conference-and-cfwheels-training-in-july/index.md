###   

### Speakers

We have some of the best speakers in the business at D2W. Many were here last year as well, like Paul Trani and Doug Winnie from Adobe. This year Seb Lee-Delisle is doing a 2-Day Hands-on Creative JS class prior to D2W. [Sign Up](http://d2wc.com/sessions) **What is workflow?** Workflow is something we all do, day in and day out â€“ although you may not even think about it. Do you work with multiple applications during the day? Do you work with team members, departments, clients, etc.? Are you a designer who wants to learn more about code? A developer who wants to know more about design? Either wanting to get into the mobile world?
