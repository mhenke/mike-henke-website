Usually I don't repost an email but I received this email from OpenCF Summit and wanted to spread the word. It was a great time last year and I loved the one track. ----------- Greetings OpenCF Summit alumni! We wanted to take a moment to thank you for making the inaugural OpenCF Summit such a tremendous success, and to let you know to save the date for OpenCF Summit 2012!  
  
Here are the important details about OpenCF Summit 2012 in a nutshell:  
  
DATES: February 24 - 26, 2012 (Friday - Sunday)  
LOCATION: Special Events Center, Dallas, TX (same great location as last year)  
PRICE: $72 for 72 hours, sleep optional!  
  
This year’s partners include GreatBizTools, Mura, Open BlueDragon, and Vivio Technologies, with more in the works. As attendees last year, you experienced first-hand the tremendous benefit of getting to spend one-on-one time with the people who create the open source CFML engines and major open source CFML applications.  
  
We’ll have more details about the schedule soon. Some of the highlights for this year will include:  
  
    Training opportunities on the first day of the event  
    Single track model to foster maximum conversation and collaboration  
    Open spaces (unconference) events throughout the three days allow you to make OpenCF Summit yours  
    The legendary OpenCF Summit Hackfest is back--code for a good cause!  
    Evening social events and birds of a feather sessions where you can mix, mingle, learn, and help shape the future of CFML  
  
All this for only $72 makes OpenCF Summit the best CFML conference value around.  
  
We’d love to have you back for OpenCF Summit 2012! We’d also appreciate you helping us spread the word, so please share this email with your co-workers and friends, or post the link to the OpenCF Summit web site on Twitter, Google+, Facebook, LinkedIn, and wherever else you think it will reach people who’d be interested in attending.

The call for speakers and registration will open very soon, so we’ll be in touch again letting you know when that’s available.  
  
Thanks so much again for attending OpenCF Summit 2011, and we’ll see you back in Dallas in February for OpenCF Summit 2012!
