next [NECFUG](http://www.necfug.com/) - Selenium with Coldfusion and MXUnit

### Next meeting: May 27th, 6pm

Tagline: Sometimes it pays to stay in bed in Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Monday's code. - Dan Salomon If you ever felt like the tag line, this meeting might help. I will be covering [Selenium](http://selenium.openqa.org/) testing with a ColdFusion flare. I'll introduce Selenium, cover the [Firefox IDE](http://selenium-ide.openqa.org/), incorporate a test into [Mxunit](http://mxunit.org/), and hopefully demo a [Selenium Grid](http://selenium-grid.openqa.org/). Bring your laptops since this will be hands on. Free Pizza and usually door prizes. [CF WebTools](http://www.cfwebtools.com) hosts the meetings and is located at 11204 Davenport, near I680 & Dodge. Discussion and pizza start around 6:00, with the presentation starting shortly after.
