I signed up for [Enterprise ColdFusion with Model-Glue](http://www.alagad.com/go/training/enterprise-coldfusion/enterprise-coldfusion-with-model-glue) a couple weeks ago. I am looking forward to learning with hands on training about Model-Glue framework, Coldspring, and Reactor/Transfer for four days. I hope enough people sign up by Jan 5th when registration ends. If your interested please check out the link or [contact Alagad](http://www.alagad.com/go/contact).
