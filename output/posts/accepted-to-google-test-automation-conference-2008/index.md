I was accepted to attend the [Google Test Automation Conference - 2008](http://googletesting.blogspot.com/2008/07/call-for-attendance-gtac-2008.html). I submitted a paragraph a while ago stating I would like to attend and bring my point of view from ColdFusion programming and unit testing with [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org) along with some other points. Then today, I received an email with the subject "GTAC Attendance", here is the beginning. _Hello,  
  
Congratulations! We are thrilled to be able to offer you a place to attend this year's Google Test Automation Conference in Seattle on October 23rd & 24th, 2008....._ So I hope to represent ColdFusion and MXUnit well :-) Guess that means I need to refocus on the Selenium/MXUnit code I was working on.
