This year I'll be going to ["Into The Box 2014" conference](http://www.intothebox.org/) at the Hilton Homewood Suites by Mall of America, Bloomington, MN. USA.  "Into The Box 2014" is May 13, one day before and near [CFObjective](http://www.cfobjective.com/). I try to attend two training events a year. Last year it was [Scotch On the Rocks](http://www.sotr.eu/) and [RailsConf](http://www.railsconf.com/). This year I'll be doing a week Java training, a scrum master 2 day class, and "Into The Box 2014". I pay for my own training usually and started budgeting [Dave Ramsey](http://www.daveramsey.com/home/) style so you can bet I am not spending my cash lightly. It is a good deal & if you fly in early you should **join me** and the other conference attendies. I am actually attending "Into The Box 2014"and not making it to CFObjective so if you aren't attending CFObjective, **join me** too. Here are some [session](http://www.intothebox.org/#sessions) I am looking forward to attending.
