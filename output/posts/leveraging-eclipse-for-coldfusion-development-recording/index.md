Here are the records of my presentation over Eclipse and ColdFusion. 07-23-09 - [CFMeetup: Leveraging Eclipse for ColdFusion Development](http://experts.na3.acrobat.com/p44388482/) 07-14-09 - [Leveraging Eclipse for ColdFusion Development (MDCFUG)](http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/p10556273/) We will cover Eclipse terms and using the Eclipse IDE (integrated development environment.) Adobe's new ColdFusion development tool, ColdFusion Builder, will be Eclipse-based so this will give you a head start toward using it. We will demonstrate how to develop ColdFusion in Eclipse starting with coding cfm and cfc pages. Once you understand Eclipse, it can be use to help code css, js, css, and even integrate seamlessly with source control and ticket systems. We will show a task-focused interface for Eclipse that reduces information overload and makes multi-tasking easy. Plugins we will be covering are basics with CFEclipse and Mylyn.
