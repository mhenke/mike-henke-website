Fusion Authority posted "[What's Hot? What's Not? Essential Tools](http://www.fusionauthority.com/community/4831-whats-hot-whats-not-essential-tools.cfm)". Please feel free to do your own post over **what tools do you use regularly to enhance your productivity (and why)?** I was honored to provide my tools for the Fusion Authority post. It is a pleasure working with Judith Dinowitz. I really enjoy watching her process of taking my very "rough" document and fleshing it out along with normal editing.  Here are a couple other tools I didn't mention:

- [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org) for a ticket system
- [WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/)
- [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org)
- [RoyalTS](http://www.code4ward.com/) \- Remote Desktop Client
- [TweetDeck](http://www.tweetdeck.com/)
- [Pandora Radio](http://www.pandora.com)
- [Git Bash](http://ruby.about.com/od/git/ss/git1_5.htm) (not the Windows command line)
- [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader)
