Title sound familiar? Well, I am borrowing it from [Raymond Camden's post](http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2010/8/9/Missed-me-at-CFUNITED-Catch-my-presentation-this-week) about his Aug 12, 12PM EST ColdFusion Online Meetup speaking engagement covering AIR, JQuery, and CFML.

I will be presenting the same day at 6PM EST my CFUnited presentation over [CFWheels](http://mikehenke.com). It will be slightly different, since I will be showing the litepost/wheels application I have been working on. If you want to get a head start, you can [take a look at the application I will be highlighting.](http://github.com/mhenke/litepost/tree/master/cfwheels/) on [Github](http://www.github.com) Visit [http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/14365384/](http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/calendar/14365384/) to RSVP. It isn't necessary but makes me look good :-)
