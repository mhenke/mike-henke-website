After listening to a quality podcast from [Hansel Minutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com) I have a better understanding of Open Source and how Eclipse's organization functions. With the recent chatter on [OpenBD](http://www.openbluedragon.org/), [Railo](http://www.railo-technologies.com/en/index.cfm), and Adobe's [CFML Language Advisory Committee](http://www.forta.com/blog/index.cfm/2008/6/19/Thoughts-On-The-CFML-Language-Advisory-Committee), I would recommend listening to it.
