A cool event [Bob Silverburg](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com) started at [CFObjective](http://www.cfobjective.com) is the Lighting Talks (formerly known as Pecha Kucha). I will be giving one over World War II Honor Flights. Here is a link to an [updated slide deck](https://docs.google.com/present/view?id=dc2sb454_464hnqp6nf6). I gave this at CFObjective 2010 and here is the video of that.
