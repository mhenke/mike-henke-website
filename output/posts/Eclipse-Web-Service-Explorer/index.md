I see RemoteSynthesis.com blogged about [Using the Eclipse Web Services Explorer](http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm/2007/4/24/Using-the-Eclipse-Web-Services-Explorer) earlier but I stumbled on the Web Services Explorer this morning working with WSDL files. You will need to have Web Tools Platform (WTP) installed. It was a little confusing but once I figured it out it was pretty nice. The icon buttons are greyed which caused me to think they weren't available. Opening a WSDL and testing was straightforward but removing was a little confusing until I figured out the icon next to the refresh was an eraser. I like being able to toggle between form and source. **Form** provides a clean interface to interact with the WSDL while **source** gets you the details of what is happening. Here is are a couple resources to get you started from http://help.eclipse.org/ : [Testing and validating Web services](http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.jst.ws.consumption.ui.doc.user/tasks/ttestwsdl.html)
