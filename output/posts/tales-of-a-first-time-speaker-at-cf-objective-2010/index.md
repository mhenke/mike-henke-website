[cf.Objective](http://www.cfobjective.com/) is still a great conference after 5 years. It is amazing how much work the people behind the conference work. This was my first year as a speaker. I have been attending the conference for several years (think I only missed the first year), paying my own way a majority of the time which is definitely worth it. It is quite an honor to speak in group with the likes of [Matt Woodward](http://blog.mattwoodward.com/), [Peter Farrell](http://blog.maestropublishing.com/), and [Simeon Bateman](http://blog.simb.net/). Guys I have been watching nail presentations over the years. I started the first day feeling random anxiety "attacks" (I use that loosely, they weren't bad) when watching sessions and thinking, I can't believe I will be doing that in front of such smart peers. I think the attendees count was around 200. cf.Objective is a programmer's conference with no fluff subjects. My first day, I started posting notes of sessions I attended but toward the end started slacking. I was fine tunining code for my my presentation and minor tweaks to slides. I had given [ColdFusion on Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org) presentations to the [MDCFUG](http://www.mdcfug.org/) and the [ColdFusion Online Meetup](http://coldfusionmeetup.com/) but totally revamped the focus of the presentation. I gathered a couple guys that evening to give my preso to and I was really nervous in front of them which is funny cause it was [Ryan Stille](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/), a friend / CF guru and a co-worker of his. They gave great suggestions (what to cut, what to focus more on, etc) and I implemented the suggestion that night. I don't think I was up past midnight. The second day, my presentation day, I woke up around 5:30am I think, tweaked some more stuff and did the presentation out loud to myself while pausing to address any issues I found. My session was the last slot before dinner break. So I attended sessions all day, but skipped the slot before mine to work on the presentation and go over it again in my head. As I walked into "my room", I couldn't believe was walking up to the front, climbing on the stage to setup my laptop into the projector and hook up a mike. First time, I have ever had to use one before besides for recordings. I think it started out a little rough but once I got going it was better. The audience asked great questions which helped and seemed very interested. I gave out shirts after finishing, several people hung out to chat which was nice. The rest of the night was a blur. I had supper with a group of people near the hotel and went to the [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pecha-kucha.org) BOF [Bob Silverberg](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/) put together. A Pecha Kucha is one speaker, 20 slides, automatically rotating after 20 secs. Bob lined up 9 speakers (me one of them) and really promoted it with business cards and podcasts. It was a great time but very nerve racking as Bob's program, flipped names for the next speaker. Thankfully, I wasn't the first selected. I think I was the third. Poor [Ben Nadel](http://www.bennadel.com/) had to sit through each random flipping waiting for his name to be selected since he ended up last. There were some really interesting topics. My Pechaa Kucha was over [World War II Honor Flights](http://www.honorflight.org/). My grandfather, 98, attended one with the [Southeastern Minnesota Honor Flight group](http://www.semnhonorflight.org/) last May before he passed away. I was lucky enough to have moved out to DC and was able to meet him at the WWII monument and be with him throughout the day. Since then I have helped out with several others. It is always a great experience I would recommend anyone look into volunteering. It is a long day but well worth it. It is always awesome to see friends like [Marc Esher](http://blog.mxunit.org/), [Luis Majano](http://www.luismajano.com/blog/), Ryan Stille, and [Terry Ryan](http://www.terrenceryan.com/). Plus great to meet extraordinary people like [Dan Wilson](http://www.nodans.com) and [Emily Christiansen](http://twitter.com/egchristiansen). Plus since with the size of the conference, you are able to say Hi to guru's like [Sean Corfield](http://corfield.org/blog/), [Raymond Camden](http://www.coldfusionjedi.com), and [Charlie Arehart](http://www.carehart.org/). I am sure I missed a bunch of people. Here is a complete [list of speakers](http://www.cfobjective.com/index.cfm/speakers/). Thanks to cf.objective for my first opportunity to present there on a framework I am really excited about [ColdFusion on Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org).
