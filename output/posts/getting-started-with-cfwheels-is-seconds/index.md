This past Sunday, I worked on updating MARC (MySQL, Apache, [Railo](http://www.getrailo.com/), and [ColdFusion On Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org/)). I haven't quite finished, but it will be using [Ubuntu 10.04](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) 3.5 with the latest [Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org), [CFEclipse](http://www.eclipse.org), and Firefox. Available on my [Wheels Download page](/page.cfm/downloads) is MARC 0.3, an older version. Also on my quick start to [Wheels Download page](/page.cfm/downloads), I have links to [Fusegrid SDK](http://www.fusegrid.com/sdk/) with ColdFusion On Wheels. This is an express, cross platform server deployment package. Getting started with Wheels using these downloads should be less than 3 steps. Enjoy.
