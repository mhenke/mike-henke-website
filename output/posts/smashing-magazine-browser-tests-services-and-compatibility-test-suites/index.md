I have been pretty busy with a quick trip to San Fransisco for a couple baseball games and siteseeing last week but today, I came across an interesting article about [Browser Tests, Services and Compatibility Test Suites](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/10/02/browser-tests-services-and-compatibility-test-suites/). Smashing Magazine seem to always have quailty posts. What stood out was the **multi installs for IE** and all the **Browser Tests: Online-Services & Tools** available. It would be interesting to add different browser version tests to a selenium ant. Or add [Browsershots](http://browsershots.org/) to a build ant for viewing the pages later.
