[Screengrab!](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1146), a Firefox extention, works on Ubuntu to save a web page as png file. Basically I had some Coldfusion output and wanted to send the whole page not a portion. I have seen several tools for windows but nothing for Ubuntu. I googled "export as png", "save as png", and "print to file as png ". Eventually I found Screengrab! and it seems to work great. ![Ubuntu Firefox Screengrab! extension](images/screengrab2.jpg)
