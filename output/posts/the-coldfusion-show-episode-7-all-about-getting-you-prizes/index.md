[Ryan Stille](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/) and I released the next [ColdFusion Show](http://coldfusionshow.com/). We have several contests with the help of awesome people providing awesome prizes like an [autographed book](http://yfrog.com/odpzjvzvj), [commerical shopping cart](http://www.cartweaver.com/welcome-to-cartweaver/), and electronic books. We also mention several contests by others. Please listen to the show, [follow us on twitter](http://twitter.com/coldfusionshow) (that will actually enter you into one contest), [rate us on itunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/coldfusion-show/id475472078), then support all the contests by entering them. Enjoy! [Episode 7: Contests, ACF10 Beta, Code School, & Angelina Jolie's Leg](http://coldfusionshow.com/episode-7-contests-acf10-beta-code-school-angelina-jolie-s-leg-1)
