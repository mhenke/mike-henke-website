I was laid off last Friday. I wasn't prepared since I liked the ColdFusion team and rest of the company's employees. I enjoyed going to work and what I was working on. The layoff was major for the company's size, 15 people out of about 45. 
  
After a lot of online applications, call backs, and several interesting phone interviews I was offered a four month contract position with a local company. I was focusing on Washington, DC, Cambridge/Somerville MA, and San Jose/San Fran areas while a local agency was working in the Omaha area for me.  
  
After my quick quest, I can tell people from my experience there are plenty of great ColdFusion jobs available in many areas of the United States. I wish I had more time to explore all the cool work.  
  
Suddenly in between opportunities, really got me to think about what I want in my pefect position. I would like to be working with smart people constantly learning. I want to be busy also, not just busy work but busy moving the company forward. I would also like a CF shop invested in frameworks or CFCs and exploring acceptance and unit testing if not already. And also a shop expanding into other languages like Flex, Java, Groovy, and even Ruby on Rails.
