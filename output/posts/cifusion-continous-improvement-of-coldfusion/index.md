I am working on [ciFusion](http://cifusion.riaforge.org/), a Bolt Extension, for Continuous Improvement of ColdFusion Code. It seems Java and .Net have many tools for metrics and code analysis but ColdFusion is several years behind. I am hoping to leverage already existing Java tools since ColdFusion works so well with it. Currently, ciFusion has a duplicate code check and a compile check. Think of the compile check as the smallest weakest possible Unit Test without a unit testing framework like [MXUnit](http://www.mxunit.org). I would like to focus on the "big five" code analysis areas from [Continuous Improvement of Code through Eclipse](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-ap01117/ ):

- Coding standards
- Code duplication
- Code coverage
- Dependency analysis
- Complexity monitoring

If you would like to help, shoot me an email henke _dot_ mike _at_ _gmail dot com_.
