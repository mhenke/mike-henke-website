[Come Work With Me](http://jobview.monster.com/getjob.asp?JobID=61615868&JobTitle=Web+Developer&q=experian+coldfusion&brd=1&cy=us&vw=b&AVSDM=2007-09-28+17%3a00%3a00&pg=1&seq=1) in addition to what the generic posting says, we are a small group. I started in January and love it. My manager is out of Portland and another coder is from Souix City, IA so there is a chance for telecommuting. The office is based out of Omaha, NE. I come and work with the DBAs and .Net guys in a nice open space with no cubes. I am exploring how to use ant and Selenium to automate tasks for better testing and productivity.
