I'll be presenting at the [NECFUG](http://www.necfug.com/) on Web Application Firewall (Waf) and a ColdFusion Waf called [FuseGuard](http://foundeo.com/security/). A Waf is a countermeasure for sercurity attacks. It can logs and blocks threats seperate from the application code. I am still working on my [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_WJR-xaEkwoa8Ybe73aaEqlHRNlTNs0k3ixKcVm7N38/edit) and [demo code](https://github.com/mhenke/fuseguardpreso).
