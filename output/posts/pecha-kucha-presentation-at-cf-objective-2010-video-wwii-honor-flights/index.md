Here is an "extra" part of the [CF.Objective()](http://www.cfobjective.com) 2010 conference I attended in Minneapolis. I was asked to present a [Pecha Kucha](http://www.pecha-kucha.org/what) along with [8 other guys](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/index.cfm/2010/4/6/cfObjective-Pecha-Kucha-BOF--On-Like-Donkey-Kong). A Pecha Kucha is a presentation with 20 slides, rotating automatically after 20 seconds. I decided to do it over the [MN Southeast Honor Flights.](http://www.semnhonorflight.org/) I was busy working on my [ColdFusion On Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org) session that occurred earlier in the day so my Pecha Kucha presentation was off the cuff and not practiced. I had a great time and thanks to [Bob Silverberg](http://www.silverwareconsulting.com/) for putting the PK event together. Enjoy!
