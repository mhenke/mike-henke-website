Don't let PHP get a jump on us :-) [Vote for structure bridges](http://tinyurl.com/2xr33b ) for CFEclipse and Mylyn [Ticket](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=220107) I entered for requesting a connector bridge for CFEclipse and Mylyn. For more on Mylyn watch [this](http://live.eclipse.org/node/412). Seems very cool. I am currently work on introducing Trac @ work and Mylyn is a reason why. Besides (major reason) our current Project/Bug system doesn't seem to work very well in our development process.
