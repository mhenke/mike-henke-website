title: "Firefox Add-On: Dust-Me Selectors"

I read [Firefox Bug: Status Bar Zaniness](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/11/08/firefox-bug-status-bar-zaniness/ ) and he briefly mentions [Dust Me Selector](http://www.sitepoint.com/dustmeselectors/), a Firefox extention, but didn't mention what it does. I quick googled it. It finds unused CSS selectors. Very cool! Nice complementary extention to use with [Firebug](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1843).
