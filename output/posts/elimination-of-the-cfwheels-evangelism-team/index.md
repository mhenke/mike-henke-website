Just a quick note to let people know that the Wheels Evangelism Team has been eliminated. I assume I will no longer be blogging on [Wheel's blog](http://cfwheels.org/blog/). This will not affect my continued support of [CFWheels](http://cfwheels.org/) (now I can refer to it as CFWheel again.) I will still be writing blog posts, speaking at user groups and conferences (provided user groups and conferences honor me with accepting my submissions), and writing an upcoming article about ColdFusion On Wheels. I may even still attempt Wheels contests and giveaways like the [LitePost Contest](http://cfwheels.org/blog/litepost-contest-winners/) or the [free shirts](http://cfwheels.org/blog/wheels-blog-badges-wallpaper-t-shirts/). I really enjoy the framework that much and hope you [download it](http://cfwheels.org/download) and [give it a try](http://cfwheels.org/docs/chapter/beginner-tutorial-hello-world).
