I found out about this recently and would like to share a **no brainer**, even a zombie from [Walking Dead](http://www.amctv.com/shows/the-walking-dead) would know this is **a deal**. If your company sends you to [CFObjective](http://www.cfobjective.com), they should become a Bronze [Sponsor](http://www.cfobjective.com/sponsors/). Why? Well, it is a unbelievable deal. Your company is already paying for your registration which is **$950** ( or $850 depending on discounts). For only **$150** more (depending on discounts maybe $250), you get pre-conference, onsite, and post conference benefits plus 1 conference pass.

## Bronze Sponsor $1,100

The cf.Objective() 2012 conference brings together a vast array of the best web developers,  
managers, and experts from around the world. As a Bronze sponsor, your company will be an  
cf.Objective() helping ensure a successful event including a high quality location to interact  
with the community. In addition, you will also receive the following benefits: _**Pre-Conference Benefits**_

- Bronze Level sponsor recognition on all website pages.
- Linked company logo and a 100 word description on the conference website sponsor page  
    ([http://www.cfobjective.com](http://www.cfobjective.com)).

_**Onsite Benefits**_

- **One (1) full conference registration.**
- Nicollet Ballroom Prefunction area booth space (10x10 ft) located in the heart of the conference.
- Small company logo on cover of conference proceedings.
- Company logo and 50 word description of your company in the conference proceedings.

_**Post Conference**_

- Company logo on post-conference web interface for six months (the cf.Objective() website will display session presentations, examples, and sample files).
