My title is long and pretty much says it all. "[Orbwave System Manager](http://www.orbwave.com/software/systemmanager/publish.htm) \- tool every CF multiple instance local developer must have." I have 5 local developer instances of ColdFusion on my laptop. I don't use them everyday so why bog down my system down on startup or throughout the day. Instead of going to the Services panel to start, stop, or restart CF server instances, I simply right-click on the Orbwave System Manager icon in the Notification area, then navigate to the ColdFusion instance, and select the option I need such as start. My screen shot shows only Stop or Restart since the instance is already running. ![](images/sm.jpg) If you double-click on the System Manager icon, you can select services for your quick list. You can even create Groups to run such as start a particular ColdFuision server instance, SQL server instance, and/or some other services together. WINDOWS ONLY (sorry ubuntu and mac users)
