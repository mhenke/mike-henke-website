ColdFusion On Wheels is a powerful web application framework that has become popular in the past few years. It is relatively easy to develop with and can be used for sites like AmtrakGuestRewards.com, or larger ones like Meritbuilder.com and Singsnap.com. You’ll spend the day working through a single concept by creating a simple blog system and learning the basics of ColdFusion On Wheels including:

- Models, Views, and Controllers
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Using Wheels plugins
