I finally went through the [ColdFusion Koans](http://bittersweetryan.github.com/ColdFusion-Koans/) (CFK) a couple weekends ago. It was a great experience. I learned more about CFML along with [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org). [Ryan Anklam](http://blog.bittersweetryan.com/) and the [ColdFusion Show](http://coldfusionshow.com/) are extending a contest for an [ColdFusion ORM](http://www.coldfusionormbook.com/) ebook.

- [ColdFusion ORM book](http://www.coldfusionormbook.com/) (electronic) from [ColdFusion Koans](http://bittersweetryan.github.com/ColdFusion-Koans/)
    1. take picture/screenshot of finished Koans then leave comment on [this blog post](http://coldfusionshow.com/post.cfm/episode-7-contests-acf10-beta-code-school-angelina-jolie-s-leg-1) with link to pictureÂ **_OR_**
    2. contribute to [ColdFusion Koans project on github](https://github.com/bittersweetryan/ColdFusion-Koans)

Basically, complete the koans, snap a picture and upload it to google plus, any of the many twitter picture hosting sites, or some place else then [comment on the latest eposide of the ColdFusion Show](http://coldfusionshow.com/post.cfm/episode-7-contests-acf10-beta-code-school-angelina-jolie-s-leg-1) with a link to the picture. You could do a screenshoot also. The winner for the ORM ebook will be randomly selected from entries. Another way is to help with the Koans project. Fix a typo, add a test, fix a ticket - anything is encouraged small or large. Here is a testimonial from a co-worker. Nic is a network admin and wanted to learn a little bit more about ColdFusion servers and CFML programming since he is supporting the infrastructure. I pointed him to [CFML in 100 mins](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes) and the CFK project. He emailed me this after completing the CFK: _Mike  
  
CFK was a **very informative set of lessons**; there are two of them which I don't completely understand. I'm going to shoot through CFML in 100 minutes tonight so I should be good to go for tomorrow.  
  
Thanks,
