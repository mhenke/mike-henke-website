I have been wanting to properly add Akismet to machblog but am unfamiliar with some concepts of MachII so I posted a challenge on [Mach-II for ColdFusion's google group](http://groups.google.com/group/mach-ii-for-coldfusion). I offered to buy the tutor something off their Amazon wishlist. Sure enough the offer was immediately accepted and here is the link [How to incorporate CFAKismet with MachBlog](http://www.premsweb.com/blogpro/index.cfm?event=showEntry&entryId=B5494326-9D63-60DA-E490811C2F27DA67). I have been working through the tutorial hence causing some sporatic issues with my rss feed and my comments/contact section.
