I'll be giving two presentations to the Online ColdFusion meetup. "Cloudy with a Chance of Tests" is tenative since it hasn't been announced by the Online ColdFusion meetup.

## Jan 12, 6pm EST: [Improve your workflow within ColdFusion Builder](http://www.meetup.com/coldfusionmeetup/events/46479072/)

Point to point integration like ticket systems are errors prone and costly. After this session you will better understand this problem and see how to increase communication and awareness all within an Eclipse based editor like ColdFusion Builder [Slides here](https://docs.google.com/present/edit?id=0AZZAxOdc0CBnZGMyc2I0NTRfOTA0ZjM3eGZ6bW4)

## Feb 2, 6pm EST: Cloudy with a Chance of Tests

We will introduce CI (continuous integration) concepts and benefits then a simple ant script you can run. Hopefully you have seen presentations over ant, setting up Jenkins, testing, and refactoring your code. I always walk away thinking this is awesome but it can be an overwhelming process to get everything working in one step. This presentation will walk you through a bridge, an intermediate step, you can use immediately in your projects to get usable feedback on your cfml code.
