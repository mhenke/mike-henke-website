[CFWheels released 0.9.4](http://cfwheels.org/download) today if you haven't heard. I really enjoy using CFWheels because of the conventions and it was designed for [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coldfusion) based on Rails ideas. [ColdFusion on Wheels](http://cfwheels.org/) provides an easy way for rapid development plus it has a built, simple to use Object-relational mapping ([ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)). [Here is the notice](http://groups.google.com/group/cfwheels/browse_thread/thread/9eed1f55279ca08b) on the [CFWheels Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/cfwheels). They also [posted an announcement on the CFWheels blog](http://www.cfwheels.org/blog/index.cfm/2009/9/15/Released-Today-ColdFusion-on-Wheels-094).
