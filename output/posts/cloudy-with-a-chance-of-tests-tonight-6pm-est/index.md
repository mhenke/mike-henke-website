## "Enlightenment must come little by little - otherwise it would overwhelm." - Idries Shah

After most unit testing, ant, or Continuous Integration (CI) presentations I wasn't in the position to start down the path with uniting testing, acceptance testing, or any automated build process with my legacy code. This wasn't the fault of the presenters discussing Hudson, refactoring legacy code so it is testable, Selenium, MXUnit, or TDD (Test Driven Development). It wasn't the fault of the legacy code either. It wasn't the developers or managers fault. When preparing for this presentation, I found I wasn't at these phases yet. _**CI is not all or nothing,**_ it is a path that progress through distinct phases. TDD (Test Driven Development) isn't till phase 5. Unit testing isn't introduced till Phase 3. Acceptance testing is phase 6. This presentation will cover Phase 1 - **no build server** and set you up for Phase 2 & 3.
