I went to my first [Nebraska ColdFusion Users Group](http://www.necfug.com). The group is ran by Ryan Stille and Mark Kruger from [CFWebtools.](http://www.cfwebtools.com/) It was a nice size group of about 16 people. The first portion of the meeting consisted of Mark showing some new CF tags in CF8 which were CFWindow, CFTab, and CFPod. The second portion was watching a previous presention by Peter Farrel over [Subversion & Trac.](http://stevenerat.acrobat.com/p31974395/) I was suprised only a couple people used Source Control. It may have been nice if during the presentation there was more interaction with the group. Maybe pausing the presentation and discussing any ideas with the group. Everyone seemed pretty cool and it would be interesting to go out to the [Green Onion](http://www.yelp.com/biz/A5YG_G1gqotM3GfDTJ8NEw) afterwards and have a couple drinks. I would love to hear the discussions that start rolling.
