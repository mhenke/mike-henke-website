I attended [CFObjective ANZ](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/) this past week. Terrence Ryan announced [a lot of cool news about ColdFusion](/coldfusion-news-from-cfoanz-keynote-twister-thunder-more). I am going to doing a series over these announcements. The first post was about upcoming improvements with [CFFile update and For in loop CFScript support of Queries](http://mikehenke.com/coldfusion-language-improvements-content-within-cffile-and-for-in-loop-of-queries-in-cfscript). This post will show slides about CFC improvements with implicit constructors, notation, and chaining.   This first slides show how you would code the cfc to take advantage of implicit constructors.

This slide shows how you can then call the set on the cfc constructors.

This slide shows how you can also set the values. I think this is different then using a set/get. This is very similiar to [ColdFusion on Wheels](http://cfwheels.org) ORM. Notice with this first call, the object is returning itself into the variable, **_mark_**, then setting something into the _**this**_ scope.

This slide shows how you can chain menthod calls. This is showing setting actions but I would think you can chain any existing method calls.
