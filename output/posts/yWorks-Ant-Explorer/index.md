Jim Priest [found](http://www.thecrumb.com/2007/10/26/15-ant-tips/) a cool Eclipse plugin to visualize ant targets and properites from yworks called [Ant Explorer](http://www.yworks.com/en/products_antexplorer_about.htm). I installed it and took a quick look. It seems interesting. Update Site URL: _http://www.yworks.com/eclipse/update_
