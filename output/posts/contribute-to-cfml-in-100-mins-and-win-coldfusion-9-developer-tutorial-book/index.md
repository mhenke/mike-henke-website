Time for another Contribute and Win contest. This will be the third [Contribute and Win](http://mikehenke.com/contribute-win-a-chance-for-object-oriented-programming). Contribute and win has had many simple and more complex contributes from various developers. Same rules as before, I will randomly select a contributor to "[CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes)" and award them the prize. You can commit once or multiple times but you will only be entered in once. I will giveaway a copy of "[ColdFusion 9 Developer Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/ColdFusion-Developer-Tutorial-John-Farrar/dp/1849690243/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1326471081&sr=8-6)" to lucky contributor of "[CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes)". The winner will be announce on Jan 31, 2012.

### Spot a typo or code example not working

All you need is an eagle eye to spot a typo or code example not working.Â 

### Fix a ticket  

[Grab a ticket](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/issues), fix it, then submit a pull request.

### Add script examples  

Want practice with script, look at a tag example and port it to script.

### Contributing is dead simple

Contributing is _dead simple_, log into [Github](http://www.github.com/) then click "[Fork and edit this file](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button)" button on the [cfml100mins.markdown](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/blob/develop/cfml100mins.markdown) file. That will automatically fork the project so you can edit the file in the browser. Once your edit is complete send me a pull request via Github and you are entered into the giveaway.
