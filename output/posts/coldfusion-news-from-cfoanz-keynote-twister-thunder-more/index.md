It has been awhile since I have seen [Terrence Ryan](http://www.terrenceryan.com/) from Adobe speak at a conference and he is as engaging as I remember. He lead off the cf.Objective (ANZ) conference with lots of news. @rebel tweeted "It's good to see just how well @tpryan understands his Australian audience #cfoanz". I think that is true for probably any audience Terry speaks to. So here are pictures of slides and some interesting tidbits.

[link to album](https://picasaweb.google.com/henkemike/TryanKeynote?authuser=0&feat=directlink) These are not exact but my notes.

- ColdFusion is a profitable product for Adobe so we will continue to enhance & sell it
- Twister is the code name for the next ColdFusion Builder upgrade
  - support for Zeus
    - server manager
    - language dictionaries
  - performance enhancements
- Quotes from Tridib Roy Chowdhury. He is the Director of Products at Adobe Systems managing products like ColdFusion, Captivate and the Adobe eLearning Suite.
  - "Business around pricing, licensing, and access (through cloud Process innovations) will eliminate the roadblocks for new users trying out the platform - to access the latest technology."
  - "Adobe continues to invest in CF as is illustrated by 4 product releases planned in the next 24 months"

Does the pricing quote suggest, a lower amount of initial capital for companies to start using ColdFusion with a subscription model or the likes? This would mean less up front investment for companies if they prefer that over the current pricing structure. With a little detective work, the upcoming 4 releases may breakdown to these:

- Zeus (Server)
- Twister (IDE)
- ???????? (Server)
- Thunder??? (IDE)

Also a nice announcement was the enhancements to CFSchedule:

- Event Handling
  - Before
  - After
  - OnError ( your code isn't correct )
  - OnMisfire ( schedule or server problem )
- Groups - Manage tasks together
- Application Specific tasks
- Chaining
- Prioritize
- Exclude dates
- Handle errors
- Pause and resume
