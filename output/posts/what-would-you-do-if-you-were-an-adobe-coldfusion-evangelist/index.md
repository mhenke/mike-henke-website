With the talk of the "ColdFusion community", I found this post interesting, [what would you do if you were a Microsoft Evangelist?](http://blogs.msdn.com/aniyer/archive/2008/04/09/what-would-you-do-if-you-were-a-microsoft-evangelist.aspx)  
  
I would change it around and ask "What would you do if you were an Adobe ColdFusion Evangelist?"  
\*What would your goals be?  
\*How many of these can you accomplish now?  
  
I emailed my college (I graduated from) to see if they would be interested in me helping setup ColdFusion for their Web Developement class and will follow up with a phone call. Another I will see if there are other local user groups non-ColdFusion related, I can attend. Small but its something. There are numerous suggestions and interesting conversations going on in the following posting:
