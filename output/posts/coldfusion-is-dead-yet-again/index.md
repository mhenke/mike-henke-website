Yet again another semi-annually, ColdFusion is dead. I suggest vote negative on the dzone landing page, but don't click through to the article _and read the article_. The link below goes to the dzone.com landing page for the article. Summary: The entry is a carbon copy of other infamous ColdFusion is dead posts with a focus on the ColdFusion Community being a closed community and not getting outside of itself to promote ColdFusion. [The State of ColdFusion](http://www.dzone.com/links/the_state_of_coldfusion.html) - Is Coldfusion dead. The Coldfusion community says, no. But in reality have we heard anything outside of the community.
