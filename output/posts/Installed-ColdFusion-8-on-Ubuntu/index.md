Installing ColdFusion 8 on Ubuntu was not complex actually it was very straight-forward. Here are the three helpful links I used.

1. [Installing LAMP On Ubuntu For Newbies](http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies)
2. [Installing ColdFusion 8 on Ubuntu Feisty Fawn](http://alan.daveline.com/blog/?p=56)
3. [ColdFusion 8 Install On Ubuntu](http://www.thecrumb.com/2007/09/07/coldfusion-8-install-on-ubuntu/)

I stopped on Step 28 on the second link and ran the 2 commands listed before exiting the ColdFusion installation process. The commands were "cd /opt/coldfusion8/bin" and "sudo ./coldfusion start". Also my Apache settings didn't match the settings in the second link so I used the settings in the third link.
