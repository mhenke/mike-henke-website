I will giveaway copy of "[Object-Oriented Programming in ColdFusion](http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Programming-ColdFusion-Matt-Gifford/dp/1847196322)" by Matt Gifford to lucky contributor of "[CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes)". All you need is an eagle eye to spot a typo or code example not working. If you are more ambition ambitious, you can revamp a section or example to make it more clear. I will announce the winner next Tuesday, July 12th. Contributing is dead simple, login to [Github](http://www.github.com) and then click "[Fork and edit this file](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button)" button on the [cfml100mins.markdown](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/blob/develop/cfml100mins.markdown) file. That will automatically fork the project so you can edit the file in the browser. Once your edit is complete send me a pull request via Github and you are entered into the giveaway.
