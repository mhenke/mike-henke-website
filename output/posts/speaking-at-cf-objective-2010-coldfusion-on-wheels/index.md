I would like to thank [cf.Objective()](http://cfobjective.com) for accepting my submission for a session over [ColdFuson on Wheels](http://cfwheels.org). [![](images/CFObjective_09_banner_468x62.jpg)](http://cfobjective.com) cf.Objective() 2010: April 22-24, 2010 at the Hyatt Regency Minneapolis, MN [Registration](https://www.bestmeetings.com/registration/cfobjective/cfobjective.cfm) Title: ColdFusion on Wheels, Inspired by Ruby on Rails Description: Inspired by [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org), ColdFusion on Wheels provides [CFML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language) developers with a rapid [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) framework for increased productivity, organized code. We'll be showing the development workflow for CFWheels starting with the basics and ending with more advanced techniques. Audience: Anyone looking for a MVC framework that works like ColdFusion developers for rapid, easy development.
