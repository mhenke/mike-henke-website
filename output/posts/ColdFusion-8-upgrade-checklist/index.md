My group @ work was tasked with upgrading our servers to ColdFusion 8. My manager asked for each of us to plan like we were the only one planning the release, then he'll gather the notes and create a best possible transition list. I did some googling found these resources. I found the performance whitepapers interesting. In the Appendix, the testing configurations and ColdFusion server settings are listed along with a link for a zip to reproduce the results.
