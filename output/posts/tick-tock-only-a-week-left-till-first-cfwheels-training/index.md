There is only a week left till my first "[Introducing ColdFusion on Wheels](http://cfwheels-training.stagehq.com/events/659/)" class before [CF.Objective()](http://www.cfobjective.com/) on May 10 and May 11th. This class is meant for anyone with some programming exprience. We will spend two days working through a single concept by creating a simple blog system, going from an idea to a finished product.

I will also be having the [same training in Omaha, July 22-23](http://cfwheels-training.stagehq.com/events/769). This is a nice middle location for people on either coast.
