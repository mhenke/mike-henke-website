I stumbed on EclipseCon 2008 presenations last night. The conference was March 17-20. Several are ColdFusion related if you are using Eclipse with Subversion, Mylyn, Debugging, Automation, or Agile. Here is a [list of the presentations](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/index.php?page=sub/). If you want to [download them all](http://www.eclipsecon.org/2008/sub/attachments/attachments_2008.zip) and sort later.
