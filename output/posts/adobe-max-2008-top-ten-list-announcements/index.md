Adobe MAX 2008 Top Ten List - Announcements 10. In the dramatic opening session, the key speaker announces Adobe will save 15% by switching their insurance to GEICO. 9. Ben Forta, [Adobe Systems Inc's](http://www.adobe.com/) Senior Technical Evangelist, says he'll be on next season's "Dancing With The Stars" -- this guy will do anything :-)8\. Ben Forta announces Adobe has created an [Amazon Machine Image](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#os) (AMI) of ColdFusion like [Railo's](http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry!default.jspa?categoryID=101&externalID=1716&fromSearchPage=true) for Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Adobe will implemented a pricing structure similar to [Amazon EC2's pricing](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/#pricing). 7. Adobe announces it's plan to fix the economy: Buy more Adobe products. 6. Jason Delmore, the Product Manager for ColdFusion, hints ColdFusion will leverage Java code coverage tools for developers (maybe [Cobertura](http://cobertura.sourceforge.net/) or [EMMA](http://emma.sourceforge.net/)) in the next release. The ColdFusion coverage reports will be produced in a number of ways and even an Eclipse plugin to get directly to the code mentioned in the report. 5. Another new feature, similar to [Seaside](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)>) during development mode, you will be able to [debug/code from within the browser](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaside_(software)#cite_ref-4>). 4. Raymond Camden during a BOF accidentally spoils Battlestar Galactica's final 10 episodes. I said 10 but ran out of ideas :-) I did swipe a couple from [David Letterman's 10 Top List](http://lateshow.cbs.com/latenight/lateshow/top_ten/). If you have any, add them to the comments...
