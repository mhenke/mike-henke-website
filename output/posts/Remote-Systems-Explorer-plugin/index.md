I have been following an interesting conversation on the CFEclipse user group, "[File Explorer issues, again](http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-users/t/6c3312fa147820cb)". It started about the File Explorer view not working in CFEclipse (Mark Drew has released a [fix](http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/index.cfm/2007/11/9/CFEclipse-1316-Released)). Eclipse forces a project approach. Some people find the transition difficult. Dreamweaver users should be familiar with the project focus. It is similiar to [defining a site](http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewContent.do?externalId=tn_14028&sliceId=1) in DW. Main idea is use whatever editor you are most productive with. CFEclipse plugin has its quirks but I made the switch a couple years ago and won't go back to Dreamweaver.  
  
Toward the end of the conversation Stephen Davison mentioned [Remote Systems Explorer](http://www.eclipse.org/dsdp/tm/) (RSE) plug-in. Attached to this entry are some snapshots.
