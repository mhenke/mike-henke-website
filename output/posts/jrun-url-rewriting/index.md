I was working on my next installment of "[So you want to create a CFWheels application?](/page.cfm/cfwheels-series)" and was able to easily get URL Rewriting on JRun which I thought was previously not available.I used the [Url Rewrite Filter](http://tuckey.org/urlrewrite/) mentioned by [Matt Woodward](http://www.mattwoodward.com) in his "[Open BlueDragon + Railo + ColdFusion on Tomcat](http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/index.cfm?event=showEntry&entryId=60F08421-5F0A-41C9-940B3681A3D09D99)" blog entry. It was very simple to setup since the instructions are well written and seemed straightfoward for the URL Rewrite Filter. I was also able to copy some Apache rewriting rules already setup in [CFWheels](http://www.cfwheels.org).
