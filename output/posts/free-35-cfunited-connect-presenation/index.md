[CFUnited](http://cfunited.com) was kind enough to release [35+ conference presentations](http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/list.cfm?search=cfunited). Hopefully it will demonstrate the quality and networking for people unable to attend, like me this year. I added the presentations to Charlie Arehart's [UGTV](http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/). Sean Corfield [blogged about the availabilty](http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/Lots_of_CFUNITED_recordings_online) Monday but I figured I would remind everyone again.
