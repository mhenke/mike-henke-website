I instant message a lot at work to fellow developers and other employees.  I needed a tool for spell checking my messages and found what looks to be a decent and reasonably priced software.  It is called **[**IMSpellchecker XP**](http://www.interactivegt.com/)**. Installation was easy (didn't even need to restart instant message client) and it seems to be working great.
