title: "Learn Flex 2 over Lunch Free"

Starting this Wed (12/12/07), several co-workers are gathering for lunch to learn Flex 2. We are blocking a hour Mondays and Wednesdays @ noon to watch [Total Training For Flex 2](http://www.totaltraining.com/prod/adobe/flex2_ria.asp?sdid=BLQUH). If you are in the Omaha area and are interested drop me an email or comment. I figure a group will keep me honest and motivated in learning Flex :-) We are using this deal from Adobe [Free Flex Training](http://direct.adobe.com/v?xJlPJvvEcvPPPWHvJ).
