## Description

A new wave of version control systems is sweeping the development community. They are grouped under the heading of \*distributed version control systems\* or DVCSs for short. The three prominent DVCS names are Bazaar, Mercurial and Git. But which one should you choose? I'll show you specifically what Git has to offer above and beyond its cousins in this 50 minute session. Your appetite for Git will be thoroughly whet through examples of how to think in terms of the very expanded capabilities that Git provides. This session will be filled with live demonstrations and thoughtful diagrams to make Git make sense. You'll walk away inspired to use Git for both your current and upcoming projects.
