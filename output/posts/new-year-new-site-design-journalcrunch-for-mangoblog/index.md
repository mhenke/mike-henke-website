I updated my site with a new theme for [Mango Blog](http://www.mangoblog.org). Mango Blog is a free and open source [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion) blogging software product. The [JournalCrunch](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/12/09/journalcrunch-wordpress-3-0-theme-free-theme-for-portfolios-and-magazines/) theme is orignally for Wordpress released exclusively for [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com) and its readers. I placed the [JournalCrunch Mango theme](https://github.com/mhenke/Mango-Blog-Theme---JournalCrunch) port on github. This code is working for my site but probably needs to be looked over by someone familiar with Mango Blog to make it an "actually" theme. The porting process was actually very easy. I used Vigilance's mango theme as a starting point. I am still working on a few minor issues. If you see any, please shoot me an email. If you use Mango Blog, please think about porting over some other WordPress Themes from [100 Free High Quality WordPress Themes: 2010 Edition](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/08/19/100-free-high-quality-wordpress-themes-for-2010/) for yourself and others. Merry Xmas and Happy New Year!
