[Ryan Stille](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/) announced last night at the NECFUG the launching of [TechOmaha.com](http://www.TechOmaha.com). Ryan is an avid attender of local user groups and saw the need for a central calendar of all the events going on in Omaha. He also is trying to record the meeting and have them available on the site. He is looking for help on design and the tweeting feature. Check it out :-)
