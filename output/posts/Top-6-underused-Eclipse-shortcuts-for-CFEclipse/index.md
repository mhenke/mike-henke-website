Similar to Nic Tunney's [Top 6 Underused ColdFusion Functions](http://www.nictunney.com/index.cfm?mode=entry&entry=E1E350D7-FF61-56C5-E94CA390F9B3D0F0) I figured I would post an Eclipse underused shortcuts for CFEclipse users. I think it was during a CFObjective presentation by [Dan Wilson](http://www.nodans.com), I witnessed the copy down shortcut (ctrl-alt-down) and was impressed. I feel many [CFEclipse](http://cfeclipse.org/) beginners don't realize Eclipse is the real power and heart while CFEclipse harnesses it and adds features. Here is my list of underused Eclipse shortcuts for ColdFusion users.

**6\. Quick Switch Editor - Ctrl+E**

_You can quickly switch editors using the Ctrl+E keybinding which opens a list of all open editors. The list supports type-ahead to find the editor as well as allows you to close editors using a popup menu or the Delete key_.

**5\. Delete commands**

Previous word - Ctrl+backspace,

Next word - Ctrl+delete

Line - Ctrl+d

To end of line - Ctrl+Shift+delete

**4\. Go to last edit location - Ctrl+Q**

_Ctrl+Q_ _takes you back to the place where you last made a change._

**3\. Now, where was I? - Alt+Left Arrow**

_Workbench editors keep a navigation history. If you open a second editor while you're editing, you can press Alt+Left Arrow to go back to the last editor. This makes working with several open editors a whole lot easier._

**2\. Faster workspace navigation - Ctrl+Shift+R**

_Ctrl+Shift+R_ _brings up a dialog that allows you to quickly locate and open an editor on any file in the workspace. In the same vein, Navigate > Go To > Resource expands and selects the resource in the Project Explorer view itself, if it has focus._

**1\. Quick access - Ctrl+3**

_You can quickly find all manner of contributions with the Ctrl-3 binding including (but not limited to) open editors, available perspectives, views, preferences, wizards, and commands. Simply start typing the name of the item you wish to invoke and we will attempt to find something in the Workbench that matches the provided string._

Be sure to check out Help --> Key Assist (Ctrl+Shift+L) for other shortcuts and remember the list changes depending on the editor you are in. The definitions in _italics_ above are from the [Eclipse Documentation](http://help.eclipse.org/help33/index.jsp).
