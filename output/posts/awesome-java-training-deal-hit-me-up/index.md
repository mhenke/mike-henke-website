I am pretty excited to announce an exclusive deal for an online Java training class at the end of April. It is for experienced coders wanting to learn Java. Shoot me an email henke dot mike at gmail dot com if are interested and I can give you more details. I have been wanting to branch out more and this class I am hoping this will help. It seems Omaha, my neck of the woods, has lots of Java jobs, some ASP.NET, and few ColdFusion jobs around. Even fewer Ruby On Rails. The would also help for Railo users wanting to help out with the source code. Take Care, Mike
