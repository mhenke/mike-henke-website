If you haven't heard, Ryan Anklam is having [a contest for ColdFusion Koans](http://blog.bittersweetryan.com/2012/02/coldfusion-koans-giveaway.html). It is very easy to contribute via the browser, http, or ssh connection with github. You don't even need to install or learn git. [ColdFusion Koans](http://bittersweetryan.github.com/ColdFusion-Koans/index.html) is a cool project for learning unit testing along with CFML.
