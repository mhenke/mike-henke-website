I watched Mark Esher's presention "[ANT On The Wire: Using FTP, Email, SVN, and VSS](http://experts.acrobat.com/p99499145/)" a couple weeks ago and liked the idea of scheduling an ant to do my SVN updates before I get into the office. He was kind enough to provide [a zip of his files](http://mxunit.org/doc/zip/CFMeetup_AntWired.zip) from the presention. Please watch the presentation to see how to setup ant.  
  
I modified his code a little so the following is based off his zip and assumes you have everything working he covered. I am storing a list of my working copy locations, my svn username, and my svn password in his unames.properties files. I changed the GetLatest.xml code to an update instead of a checkout and added a loop so I could update all my working copys. The looping feature is accomplished with [Ant-Contrib](http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/). You will have to install this like Mark shows for the other jars.  
  
I made a bat file to fire off the GetLatest.xml Ant. It also creates a log file for the latest run. I created a shortcurt of the bat file, putting it in my start menu so I can fire it easily. I also put a shortcut in my startup just incase Windows Task Scheduler doesn't work. I set Windows Task Scheduler to run the bat file every morning before I get into the office.  
[  
Included in my zip](http://mikehenke.com/machblog/uploads/enclosures/GetLatest.zip) is the revised GetLatest.xml, unames.properties, GetLatest.bat, and GetLatest.log files _Files in zip:  
**[GetLatest.xml](#GetLatest_XML)** \- ant script to run svn update over a list of working copy paths_  
_[**unames.properties**](#unames) - contains variabes settings such svn login information and working copy paths_  
_[**GetLatest.bat**](#GetLatest_bat) - runs the GetLatest.xml ant and outputs a log files__  
**GetLatest.log** - output from running the GetLatest.bat_ **GetLatest.xml**
