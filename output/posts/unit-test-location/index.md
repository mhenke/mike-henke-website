I put a question in Mxunit's google group about testing location? I remember someone @ CF.Objective mentioned tests should be in a seperate location like trunk, branches, tags, and **tests**. If you have any advice please chime in. I have disabled comments on this post so the discussion will occur in Mxunit's google group.
