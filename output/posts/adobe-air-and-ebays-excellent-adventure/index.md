Yesterday, a new eBay [San Dimas](http://www.projectsandimas.com.) Beta Version was announced.Â  You may wonder what it is _San Dimas_.Â  It has nothing to do with William "Bill" S. Preston, Esq. and Ted "Theodore" Logan, San Dimas's most famous fictional citizens.Â  San Dimas actually is a desktop application from eBay using [Adobe Air](http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/), formerly code-named Apollo. Suprising, little publicity has been made about eBay embracing Adobe AIR. AIR is "a cross-operating system runtime that allows developers to use their existing web development skills to build and deploy rich Internet applications to the desktop." [New eBay San Dimas Beta Version Available](http://blogs.ebay.com/projectsandimas/entry/New-eBay-San-Dimas-Beta-Version-Available/_W0QQidZ316711010) _**Thanks** to [Rey Bango](http://www.reybango.com/) and [Ajaxian for linking in his post](http://ajaxian.com/archives/ebays-san-dimas-desktop-application-hits-v06) this entry_.
