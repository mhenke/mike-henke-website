Interestly Amazon has released a limited beta for a web service for running queries on a structured database called [Amazon SimpleDB](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_c_1_3435361_1?ie=UTF8&node=342335011&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA). Amazon must see a need in the marketplace for this but I am kinda sceptical. Here is an good article on the subject "[Amazon Takes on Oracle and IBM With SimpleDB](http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/14/amazon-takes-on-oracle-and-ibm-with-simple-db-beta/)"
