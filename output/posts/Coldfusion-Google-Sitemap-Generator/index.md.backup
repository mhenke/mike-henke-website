I was looking for a sitemap.xml generator and stubbled across this [Google Sitemap Generator Code](http://64.233.179.104/translate_c?hl=en&langpair=it%7Cen&u=http://blog.merlinox.com/MrX/blog/_mod/index/t/CF--Google-Sitemap-Generator/news/414) .Â  I emailed the gentleman asking if I could put his code on riaforge.com and update it.Â  He graciously said "Of Course".Â  I added a pinging function for Yahoo, Google, and Ask.Â  It submits the sitemap.xml file for their respected search engines.Â  I also made sure the [xml validated](http://www.w3.org/2001/03/webdata/xsv) properly. I will add better documentation but it should be pretty self explainitory.Â  Please let me know of any problems because this is untested in other enviroments. UPDATE: This project has been added to [RIAForge.org](http://RIAForge.org) as [Google Sitemap XML Generator](http://googlesitemapxmlgenerator.riaforge.org/)[  
](http://googlesitemapxmlgenerator.riaforge.org/)
