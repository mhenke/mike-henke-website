I made a quick hack to Machblog to support Google SMTP servers.Â  I will go back and add the property to the xml file later.Â  The hack was very easy since I am running Coldfusion 8.Â  I added the attribute useTLS = "yes" to any cfmail tags I found in the code.Â  Here are some links about this topic: [Peter about adding TLS securty support for Machblog](http://groups.google.com/group/mach-ii-for-coldfusion/browse_frm/thread/608cdead2943930d)
