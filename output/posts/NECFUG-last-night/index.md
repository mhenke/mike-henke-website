Nebraska ColdFusion Users ([NECFUG](http://www.necfug.com/)) meeting was last night. This was my second time attending and I hope to keep attending. The main presentation was by Jake Churchill, works @ [CF WebTools](http://www.cfwebtools.com/), about [FarCry](http://www.farcrycms.org/). FarCry is an open-source content management system build on ColdFusion. It was a pretty interesting presentation. I have thought of using it for a small project before. I would like to thank Mark Weishahn at [Diversified Solutions](http://www.div-sol.com/) for sponsering the meeting. As usually free pizza and soda was available before the meeting started and several drawings were held @ the end for books and gift cards. I actually won a $35 gift card for Barnes & Nobles from Diversified Solutions. About 10 people attended and it is alway nice to meetup with fellow CF-ers.
