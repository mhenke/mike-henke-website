I started to watch the first lesson of [Using the Eclipse Workbench](http://live.eclipse.org/node/469) last night but got distracted with the CNN debate. I was about finished and the training seemed pretty good. I noticed the [downloads](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=200662&package_id=260599) include a swf for the tutorial which is nice if you are offline.
