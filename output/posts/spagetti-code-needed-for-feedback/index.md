Majority of ColdFusion code is not testable in its current state. There I said it. Now with that out of the way, I would love you to try out my "[Cloudy With A Chance Of Tests](https://github.com/mhenke/Cloudy-With-A-Chance-Of-Tests)" project and give this a test drive. It is to help improve the quality of your code which maybe in any state. Please [create issues](https://github.com/mhenke/Cloudy-With-A-Chance-Of-Tests/issues) for any problems or clarifications needed. Currently, the compilation only works on the Adobe ColdFusion engine. For more information on where I am coming from and trying to go, please review: [Why a compile test on CFML, a dynamic language?](http://mikehenke.com/post.cfm/why-a-compile-test-on-cfml-a-dynamic-language) [Building a bridge for Unit Testing - CI in CFML](http://mikehenke.com/post.cfm/building-a-bridge-for-unit-testing-ci-in-cfml) [Cloudy With A Chance Of Tests Outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1biLTSfLfZxdwLI78Jo2lID_w-pKAqnR63csfu8mT9EA/edit)
