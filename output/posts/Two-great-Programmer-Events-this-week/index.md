[Ryan Stille](http://ryan.cfwebtools.com/), CFWebTools' [uber geek of the year](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/2008/04/08/uber-geek-award/) , mention to me about two Programming events occuring in Omaha this week. I have been looking forward to the git presentation but forgot about it since it was cancelled last time. And the BarCamp I heard some rumblings but nothing concrete. If you are within driving range, the two events should be worth your time. [Omaha Dynamic Language User Group](http://odynug.kicks-ass.org) - tomorrow night covering GIT [Omaha BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/BarCampOmaha) - looks like some good sessions this weekend
