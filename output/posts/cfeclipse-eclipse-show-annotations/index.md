I did a quick search for good examples of the Show Annotations feature in Eclipse but didn't find any so I figured I would post some. I also checked Eclipse's documentation and found none. The closest I came was [a post](http://www.thecrumb.com/2008/02/07/cfeclipse-in-the-gutter/) by Jim Crumb Priest. Starting in the the Navigator View, I right-click on the file, then select Team --> Show Annotation ![Show Annotation](images/showAnnotation1.jpg) Then after the file processes, the file appears in my Editor panel. In the gutter, I have information related to each line and how it got to the current state. If I mouse-over the line number, I get information about the line and it "boxs" out the other lines also changed with the specific commit. ![Show Annotation](images/showAnnotation2.jpg) This last image shows different options to customize the coloring and information shown in the gutter by right-clicking on the gutter. ![Show Annotation](images/showAnnotation3.jpg)
