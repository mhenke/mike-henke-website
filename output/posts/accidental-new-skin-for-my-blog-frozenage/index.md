I was working on a new skin for machblog and accidently pushed it live last night. I need to clean up the search button and the forms. I have a couple skins I hope to finish up and send to the guys. This one is called [frozenage](http://www.freecsstemplates.org/preview/frozenage). I hadn't planned to actually use this. I have another skin I was going to use for my blog.
