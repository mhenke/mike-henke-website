I am presenting HeadFirst Debugging with FusionDebug to the [Southeast Minnesota ColdFusion User Group](http://www.bittercoldfusion.com/). Thursday, November 20, 2008 at 10:00 AM (CENTRAL)

"This meeting and presentation will be done through Adobe Connect. Anyone can join the meeting by going to this URL [http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r50968001/](http://adobechats.adobe.acrobat.com/r50968001/) " [FusionDebug](http://www.fusion-reactor.com/fd/) is a great tool for any ColdFusion developers.
