## why join me for java training

- Master object-oriented application design and programming
- Understand Java incase I want to use Groove or another language from the Java platform

I am hoping after this class, I'll be able to:

- Leverage my Web and ColdFusion skills to develop powerful Java applications
- Understand the similarities and differences between CFML and Java development
- Integrate ColdFusion with J2EE and servlet technology
- Know the advantages of Java classes to leverage ColdFusion power

I grabbed the above bullet points from these resources.
