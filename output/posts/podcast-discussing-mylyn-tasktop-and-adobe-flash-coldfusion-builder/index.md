Recently, I was honored to be on the [2 Devs from Down Under](http://www.2ddu.com/) podcast discussing an upcoming session for [CFObjective ANZ](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/) titled "Task-Oriented Workflow With Adobe Flash & ColdFusion Builder". [I edited down my discussion to just over 17 mins here.](http://d2rqv4eo8j237w.cloudfront.net/2-devs-from-downunder-XIII-edited.mp3) I was on a panel of 2 other speakers. If you wish to listen to the whole podcast, you can find it here: [Even more speakers - and Kai wins](http://www.2ddu.com/2011/09/22/even-more-speakers-and-kai-wins/). I briefly mentioned the One Day [ColdFusion On Wheels Intro](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/program/workshops/) before the conference. **_Please sign up and support the conference and training!_** Thanks I had such a great time, [Ryan Stille](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/) and I are going to give podcasting a try for three eposides over the next 6 weeks. We are going to keep it light and short (under 20 minutes) mentioning items from my shared [Google Reader](http://www.google.com/reader/shared/henkemike) and [favorite tweets](http://twitter.com/#!/mikehenke/favorites) along with news Ryan finds interesting.
