I enjoy listening to [Hal Helms](http://www.halhelms.com/) and he recently was on an [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/) podcast, [Cloud Out Loud](http://www.engineyard.com/podcasts). He brings a thought provoking perspective to discussions. He learned a new skillset, [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), after being a long time [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion) programmer. [The podcast is definately worth listening to](http://www.engineyard.com/podcast/s01e37-hal-helms) and is just over 15 minutes. I wish he would have mentioned ColdFusion is not only [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html) but does have open source options like [Railo](http://www.getrailo.com/) and [OpenBD](http://www.openbluedragon.org/) during the open source discussion. The ACF long release cycle is a thought provoking point compared to quick release cylce software especially these days when technology advances and changes so fast. Also a mention of [ColdFusion on Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org), a framework based on Rails, would have been awesome. **Podcast Information** [S01E37: Hal Helms](http://www.engineyard.com/podcast/s01e37-hal-helms) Published: August 26, 2011 Summary: Hal Helms discusses his Cold Fusion background and his interest in Ruby and Rails.
