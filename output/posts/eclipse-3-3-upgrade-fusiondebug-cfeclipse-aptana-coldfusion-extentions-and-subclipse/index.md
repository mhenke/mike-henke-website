I finally am upgraded to Eclipse 3.3. Everything went smooth with FusionDebug, CFEclipse, Aptana, and Subclipse. I did stumble a little with finding the current [ColdFusion Extentions](http://download.macromedia.com/pub/coldfusion/8/eclipseextensions/cf8_extensions_for_eclipse.zip) so here is the direct link. My old archived site pointed to CF_FB_Extensions.zip and the new one is called cf8_extensions_for_eclipse.zip. Hope this helps someone :-) FYI - I did get the direct link from comment posted on Eclipse 3.3 and the [ColdFusion Extensions for Eclipse](http://www.cfreport.org/index.cfm/2007/8/17/Eclipse-33-and-the-ColdFusion-Extensions-for-Eclipse) entry for CFReport.org's blog. At first I thought my old FusionDebug setting weren't available anymore
but found them (Run --> Open Debug Dialog... Or by selecting the bug  
icon drop down box and then selecting Open Debug Dialog)
