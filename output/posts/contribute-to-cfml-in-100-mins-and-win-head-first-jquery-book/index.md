Time for another Contribute and Win contest. The last [Contribute and Win](http://mikehenke.com/post.cfm/contribute-win-a-chance-for-object-oriented-programming) seemed a great success. I had many awesome contributes. Same rules as before, I will randomly select a contributor to "[CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes)". You can commit once or multiple times but you will only be entered in once. I will giveaway a copy of "[Head First jQuery](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449393217)" to lucky contributor of "[CFML in 100 minutes](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes)".

### Spot a typo or code example not working

All you need is an eagle eye to spot a typo or code example not working. If you are more ambitious, [grab a ticket](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/issues) or create another example or section. I will announce the winner Tuesday, Oct 13th.

### Contributing is dead simple

Contributing is dead simple, log into [Github](http://www.github.com/) then click "[Fork and edit this file](https://github.com/blog/844-forking-with-the-edit-button)" button on the [cfml100mins.markdown](https://github.com/mhenke/CFML-in-100-minutes/blob/develop/cfml100mins.markdown) file. That will automatically fork the project so you can edit the file in the browser. Once your edit is complete send me a pull request via Github and you are entered into the giveaway.
