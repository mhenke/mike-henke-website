I attended the [Omaha BarCamp](http://www.barcampomaha.com) 2010 this past Sat. The [BarCamps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp) I have attended are a great way to meet passionate creative people in your location. BarCamps are an unconference with user generated content. Whomever shows up can present on a topic they are passionate about. Here is a more about the [BarCamp Omaha 2010 Schedule (plus morning photos)](http://www.siliconprairienews.com/2010/11/barcamp-omaha-2010-schedule-plus-morning-photos).   I presented a ColdFusion topic, ColdFusion On Wheels (Stealing Ideas from Rails). I had about a dozen people in my session. I did a quick dis-spelling of ColdFusion misconceptions like it is a relic, costs money, etc then talked a little about [CFWheels](http://www.cfwheels.org). The session was only 30 mins so I kept it light.   I had a great positive time at the camp, except the Omaha BarCamp is organized by a couple Rails guys.  As the announcer read my topic, he ad-libbed some snide comment about ColdFusion being outdated. I was prepared so at the start of my session I had wikipedia pulled up with [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion) and [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) summaries. Basically, both languages appeared in 1995 and have had recent releases within the last 6 months. As for Rails verses any ColdFusion framework, I assume the same can be said.   I also mentioned ColdFusion has different engines so you have choices between open source like [Railo](http://www.getrailo.com) or [Open Blue Dragon](http://www.openbluedragon.org) or proprietary like [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion). Finally I mentioned if you don't like the tag syntax, you have the option for more of a scripting syntax.  

## Attend One in your location!!!

I would recommend anyone checking the web for a BarCamp near you, attend, and present something over ColdFusion.
