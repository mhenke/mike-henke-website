[Chaz Chumley](http://cfwheels.org/user/profile/123) mentioned [ColdFusion On Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org) will be having two sessions and a Bird of Feathers at [CFUnited 2010](http://www.cfunited.com) on the [Wheels Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/cfwheels). I missed the original announcement on the BOF. If you aren't a member of the Google Group, you should check it out. The group is really friendly and will answer any and all questions on Wheels.
