Well, I was fed up with Vista on a new laptop I purchased in March 2007.Â  Vista performance was horrible and it was buggy.Â  I would get the blue screen of death when starting Windows Media Player along with the cpu pegging out when doing anything.Â  The laptop is an Acer Aspire (details later) for around $500.Â  The Windows Experience registered around 3.1.Â  Installing [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) desktop edition was flawless and immediate updates after the cd installation was painless.Â  Everything (DVD, CD, Monitor, Sound, Wireless Internet, Graphics) worked from the start, no adding drivers or messing with configuration.Â  Adding/removing software is a breeze through the user interface.Â  Performance and stability seems 110% better then Vista. UPDATE 8/27/207:Â  I did notice Flash won't work properly. I think it has something to do with my AMD64 processor.Â  I did a quick google and seems to be work-arounds. UPDATE 9/13/207: Not sure what I did but Flash runs fine now.
