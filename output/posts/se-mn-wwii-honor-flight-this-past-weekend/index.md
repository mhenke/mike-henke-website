I have been helping with the [SE MN Honor Flights](http://www.semnhonorflight.org) since my grandfather was on one. I think this is my 5th. It is always a privilege to help. I heard there maybe only two more from this hub. The last flight had several veterans passing away before they could see their memorial. We had over 100 veterans and 60 guardians this flight.  I would suggest you become a guardian for a flight in your area while they are still going on. It is well worth the money and your time. And if you have a relative from WWII, I would definitely fill out an application so they can see their memorial.
