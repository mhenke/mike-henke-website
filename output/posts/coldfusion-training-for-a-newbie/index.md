My company recently hired another developer. It was the first time I was involved in the hiring process. We hired a recent college graduate with no CFML experience and slight PHP. The grad did seem somewhat strong with HTML, SQL, and CSS. Javascript was slight and jQuery non-existant. I'll be doing blog series on the training as it progressing. We will focus on [CFML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion) the first week, with a little [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) at the end of the week. Then the second week we will focus on [Git](http://git-scm.com/), SQL, and a little CSS. Training will ideally be broken into half days with learning the company, application, and ticket system. The other half day will be learning [Adobe ColdFusion](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-family.html), [ColdFusion Builder](http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion-builder.html) and other programming skills. Here is the [training material and schedule](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qvIlIze26xZnY3nJnmGG8Yg31huxD_8-zxB434gAKKY/edit). I also gave the developer a copy of [ColdFusion 8 Developer Tutorial](http://www.amazon.com/ColdFusion-Developer-Tutorial-John-Farrar/dp/1847194125/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1337091366&sr=8-2). We are using ACF9 but didn't have a copy of the updated book. I also picked up [Railo 3 Beginner's Guide](http://www.amazon.com/Railo-Beginners-Guide-Mark-Drew/dp/1849513406/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1337091542&sr=8-1). This opportunity is a great chance to try [my recommended CFML books for newbies](/is-adobe-coldfusion-web-application-construction-kit-series-bad-for-new-cfml-developers).
