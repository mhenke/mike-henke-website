I was asked toÂ lead an Unconference session on [CFWheels](http://www.cfwheels.org) at the [OpenCF Summit](http://www.opencfsummit.org/). They are hoping to have a session for each of the major MVC frameworks. It should be a great time to learn and hang out with fellow ColdFusion developers. The conference is in Dallas, TX from February 21-23. If you can still make it, the [registration](http://www.brownpapertickets.com/event/137534) is less than 40 bucks for a 3 day conference with 1 track [schedule](http://www.opencfsummit.org/index.cfm/schedule/). Hope to see you there!
