I am the guy when watching a presentation, glances @ the presenter's taskbar to see what icons are in the panel. Or notes their IDE setup incase the perspective layout seems useful. I was hoping you will share your CFEclipse perspective layout with the CF community. So to start us out a larger [snapshot](http://mikehenke.com/machblog/images/cfeclipse_ubuntu.jpg) of my home setup :-) _**Update:** http://www.flickr.com/groups/showusurcfeclipse/_
