Anyone have an example of using Selenium and having a skeleton main file the loads a variables file for setting variables. Example, variables file would have address, town, city, and state variables with approriate values. Then you could interchange the variables file for different address in the main script. I am using Selenium Firefox IDE. I think this would be simple with the Selenium Test Runner but haven't started on that adventure yet.
