I stumbed across [LeechBlock.](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/4476) I installed it @ work to help me stay more focused and not get distracted on the web. So far it works great for me. Check out the link for more info and pics. _"LeechBlock is a simple productivity tool designed to block those time-wasting sites that can suck the life out of your working day." **\- from LeechBlocker's Firefox Add-ons page**_
