I created a wiki page called [Trac Case Studies in SCM & Project Management Process](http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracCaseStudies) on trac.edgewall.org for a centralized place of how different people/companies structure their Trac setup. I am working on setting up Trac and haven't found any good references for laying out Trac like multiple Trac projects - one repository, etc.
