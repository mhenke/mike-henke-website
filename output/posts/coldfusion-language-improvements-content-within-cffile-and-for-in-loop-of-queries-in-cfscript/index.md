I attended [CFObjective ANZ](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/) this past week. Terrence Ryan announced [a lot of cool news about ColdFusion](/post.cfm/coldfusion-news-from-cfoanz-keynote-twister-thunder-more). I am going to do a series over these announcements. I think the biggest was **_"Adobe continues to invest in CF as is illustrated by 4 product releases planned in the next 24 months"_** and _**"ColdFusion is a profitable product for Adobe so we will continue to enhance & sell it."**_ My first announcement blog post will be Zeus **CFFile update** and **For in loop CFScript support of Queries** upcoming improvements. For In Looping of Queries:
