[Ryan Stille](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/) and I recorded [another ColdFusion Show](http://coldfusionshow.com/episode-2-loops-with-qoq-cfo-call-for-speakers-and-topics). [ColdFusionShow.com](http://coldfusionshow.com/), [itunes](http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/coldfusion-show/id475472078), and [feedburner](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ColdFusionShow) have been setup. We talk about loops with Query of Queries (QoQ), CFObjective call for speakers and topics, intellij idea, local dev setup, Keith Olbermann, new / upcoming ColdFusion books and more. This is the second of a three eposide run. The quality seemed better as we get our podcasting legs. We cover a lot of topics in just over 20 minutes, so [go to the episode page and listen :-)](http://coldfusionshow.com/episode-2-loops-with-qoq-cfo-call-for-speakers-and-topics)
