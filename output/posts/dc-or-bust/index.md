My blogging has been non-existant over the last month since I have been busy traveling, interviewing, and moving. I can say from experience there are alot of interesting ColdFusion jobs, people, and opportunities. Contact me (henke dot mike @ gmail dot com ) if you are in the DC area and looking, I know of a great job still available for an awesome company. My first day was today @ Bid4Assets.com in Silver Spring, MD. I walked to work this morning since it is close. And I didn't bring my car (so I will be walking every day.) I left pretty much everything else except some clothes, a sleeping bag, a dog, and a cat. I am leaving Omaha (though I still am keeping my house there) and moved to an apartment in DC.
