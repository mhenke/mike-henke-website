I had the privilage to participate in a [Bolt Talk](http://cfmumbojumbo.com/cf/index.cfm/bolttalks/) with [Tim Cunningham](http://cfmumbojumbo.com/cf/index.cfm/who-am-i/). If you are passionate about a project, topic, or pretty much anything related to programming, do one now. All you need to do is [contact Tim](http://cfmumbojumbo.com/cf/index.cfm/who-am-i/). It was a great experience and easy since Tim handles recording and editing.

### BoltTalk

"A BoltTalk is a short podcast with a single interview on a single narrowly focused topic of interest to people in the programming community. If you would like to talk to me for a few minutes on any topic that would be of interest to the programming community, for less than 15 minutes, please submit them to me via gmail: timcunningham71 . This article gives you more background on the genesis and purpose of a BoltTalk."

### Cloudy with a chance of tests  

Mike Henke talks about trying to introduce continuous integration and unit testing into his legacy code. Taking a "baby steps" approach he tells how he sets up a continuous integration environment, to test code changes even without unit testing.
