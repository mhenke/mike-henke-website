This is a pre-[CF.Objective](http://www.cfobjective.com/) 2 day workshop on May 10-11 in Minneapolis, MN. [ColdFusion On Wheels](http://cfwheels.org/) is a powerful web application framework that has become popular in the past few years. It is relatively easy to develop with and can be used for awesome sites like [AmtrakGuestRewards.com](http://amtrakguestrewards.com/), or other cool ones like [Meritbuilder.com](http://meritbuilder.com/) and [Singsnap.com](http://singsnap.com/). Youâ€™ll spend the two days working through a single concept by creating a simple blog system and learning the basics of ColdFusion On Wheels including:

- Models, Views, and Controllers
- Data Structures & Relationships
- Routing
- Migrations
- Views with forms, partials, and helpers
- RESTful design
- Using Wheels plugins
