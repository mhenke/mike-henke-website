I stumbled across [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com) awhile ago. It is usually a well organized and informative podcast. What is Hanselminutes?  
Hanselminutes is a weekly audio talk show with noted web developer and technologist Scott Hanselman and hosted by Carl Franklin. Scott discusses utilities and tools, gives practical how-to advice, and discusses ASP.NET or Windows issues and workarounds. Here are a couple I burned and enjoy listening to.

- [Continuous Integration](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=5)
- [Globalization/Internationalization with .NET](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=36 )
- [Dynamic vs Compiled Languages](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=40 )
- [Squeezing the most out of Continuous Integration - with Jay Flowers](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=70)
