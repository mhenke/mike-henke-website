Charlie Arehart has been very busy lining up great [Online ColdFusion Meetup Group](http://coldfusion.meetup.com/17/) meetings. If you don't know about the group it is an awesome learning resource. Charile has setup a site, [UGTV](http://www.carehart.org/ugtv/), for finding ANY usergroup recorded presentions. UGTV holds links to the recordings along with a title, description, time, presenter, and date. UGTV is great if you miss a presentation or want to share one. Anyone can submit urls.
