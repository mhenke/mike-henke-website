Doug Hughes [announced](http://www.alagad.com/go/blog-entry/feburary-model-glue-training-joe-will-present-on-model-glue-3) Enterprise ColdFusion with Model-Glue training registration was extended till Jan 25th. I am excited enough people registered so the [Model-Glue training program](http://www.alagad.com/go/training/enterprise-coldfusion/enterprise-coldfusion-with-model-glue) wasn't cancelled. I am looking for a roommate to split a hotel room @ the class's site, [Hilton Garden Inn Arlington Courthouse Plaza](http://www.hiltongardeninn.com/en/gi/hotels/index.jhtml?ctyhocn=DCAARGI) hotel. I checked online and it seems a 2 bed (queen-sized) room runs around $200 per night. Please contact me if you are interested. I am flying in probably Sunday night and haven't decided when I was heading back to Omaha.
