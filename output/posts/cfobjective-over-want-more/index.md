With another outstanding [CFObjective](http://cfobjective.com/) over, I would like to mention [d2w](http://d2wc.com/) is coming up in July. This conference will have familiar faces from CFObjective and CFUnited along with many others since this conference focuses on **Workflow** for _Developers_ and _Designers_. Sessions are geared toward improving workflow. And what would a Workflow conference be without [Mylyn](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn/) / [TaskTop](http://www.tasktop.com) being covered, so kicking off the first sessions, I will be presenting "[A Task-Oriented Workflow with Mylyn and Eclipse](http://d2wc.com/speakers/mike-henke)". Also in July, another 2 Day [Introduction into ColdFusion On Wheels](http://cfwheels-training.stagehq.com/events/769) will be held.
