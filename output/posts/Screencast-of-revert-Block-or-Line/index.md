Here is a [screencast of reverting a line or block or code](http://mikehenke.com/machblog/uploads/screencast/revert.swf.html) with two-clicks I had some code I wrote, then had to undo the changes. As some of you may know CFEclipse sometimes throws an error and goofs up the undo making a mess of pound signs and coldfusion tags. I created this screencast from [CamStudio](http://camstudio.org/). It is free and very easy. I found out about the software from this article, [Screencasting: How to Start, Tools and Guidelines](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/08/19/screencasting-how-to-start/).
