I'll be traveling to Melbourne, Australia next week to give an ["Introduction Into ColdFusion on Wheels" workshop](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/program/workshops/) and attend [cfObjective (AUZ)](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/). I would love at least one more person to [register](http://www.cfobjective.com.au/register) for the the CFWheels workshop so please consider it if you are in the Melbourne area. The workspace was give before at [CFObjective](http://www.cfobjective.com/) pre-conference training last year and it was a lot of fun. We do the whole workshop without writing a single line of sql using ColdFusion on Wheels built in ORM and a DBMigrate plugin. It is pretty awesome. During the conference, I'll be presenting on ColdFusion and Flash Builder using Task focused workflow. This is a great session covering tools already available for a developer using Eclipse and doesn't involve any changes in your existing ticket solution.
