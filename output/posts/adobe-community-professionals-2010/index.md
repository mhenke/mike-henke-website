I am proud to announce I was accepted into the [Adobe Community Professional](http://lizfrederick.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-acps-for-2010.html) for 2010!!! I have had an exciting month, due to [ColdFusion On Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org). I am not part of the [Wheels core team](http://cfwheels.org/community/core-team), just some who found a framework that works like I code and have been trying to get the word out about it. You can see my open source projects on [Github](http://github.com/mhenke). ![Adobe Community Professional](images/acp_logo.gif)
