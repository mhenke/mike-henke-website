Thanks to [Ryan Stille](http://www.stillnetstudios.com/) for the patiences of checking out 10 or so bikes from craigslist before we found one that met his approval. This morning he saw an ad for [1982 Honda CM450](http://omaha.craigslist.org/mcy/2586144756.html). Over lunch we kicked the tires and walked around checking things (actually I just watch Ryan.) It met his first examination ok, just some small issues, so he test rode it. It passed this test also so we negotiated and both parties I think are happy. This is my first motorcycle. I had a [2 day safety course](http://www.safenebraska.org/safe-driving/motorcycle-training.php) a couple weeks ago. First time ever riding a motorcycle. ![](images/bike_photo.JPG) ![](images/bike_photo1.JPG) ![](images/bike_photo2.JPG)
