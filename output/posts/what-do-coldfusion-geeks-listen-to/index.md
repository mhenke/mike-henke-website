What do ColdFusion geeks listen to? I joined the [ColdFusion Music Group](http://www.last.fm/group/Coldfusion/) last weekend. I have been using [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/) for awhile and it has helped me discover artists and cool songs by tracking my music listening through different music players.
