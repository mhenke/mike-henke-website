This entry is quick review of built in Eclipse functionality not to be confused with CFEclipse or Aptana features, the _Navigator view toolbar_. I will show the _Link With Editor_, _Go Into, Forward, Back, and Up buttons_. I use the Link With Editor Button hundreds of times a day. It jumps the navigator to the page with the editor focus. I usually have it off then toggle it on, when I have the file in my editor and toggle it off after the navigator jumps to the file's location. This snapshot with the about.cfm page in the editor would find the about.cfm page show it in the navigator. ![Link With Editor button](images/lweb.jpg) The next feature I don't use much but maybe useful to others. It is "Go Into". Not really a button on the Navigator view toolbar but it works with several. ![Go Into](images/go.jpg) Notice in my next screenshot, the _Navigator view_ only shows the folder and subfolders of the folder I had highlighted when I right-clicked and selected "Go Into". Also two buttons have been activated. Think of the _Back button_ as a web browser back button. It tracks the journey you have used to get to the location. _Forward button_ isn't activated but will become if I used the Back button. _Move Up button_ will moved up a folder level, so with my screenshots it would go to the www folder. ![Back and Up button](images/other.jpg)
