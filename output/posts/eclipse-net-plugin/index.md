After John Bland's presentation on CF8 .Net integration, which was really cool, I thought it was kinda a pain how he had to switch between two editors, one for cfm and another for vistual studio. I did a quick search and found a recent article from IBM on [using an Eclipse .Net plugin](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-eclipse-migratenetvs/). One reason my company is upgrading to CF8 was the potential to integrate .Net with ColdFusion.
