I started a [Head First ColdFusion](http://github.com/mhenke/Head-First-ColdFusion) book to submit to [Head First](http://headfirstlabs.com/writeforus.php).Â If anyone is interested in contributing, it is using [markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and on [GitHub](http://www.github.com). The idea is based on the [Pro Git book](http://progit.org/) using the same [technique](http://github.com/blog/465-pro-git-book).
