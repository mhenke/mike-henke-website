Next [NECFUG](http://www.necfug.com/) meeting: July 22nd - [Axel Jensen](http://www.axelscript.com/) will be talking about the development process. More details to come. ---- Should be interesting. Axel is very passionate about Flex and ColdFusion. I heard the initial outline concept and it was covering how to use Subversion, Mylyn, ANT, and Trac. Very broad so he probably consolidated his thoughts.
