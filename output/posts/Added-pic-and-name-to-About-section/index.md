Due to an oversite, I didn't have my name on my [About](http://mikehenke.com/machblog/index.cfm?event=showAbout) section or Contact form so I added it and a picture to my About section. The picture was recently taken @ a company Lazer Tag event. It was fairly cold but fun. Thanks to [Charlie Arehart](http://www.carehart.org/) for pointing out my full name was missing on the website :-)
