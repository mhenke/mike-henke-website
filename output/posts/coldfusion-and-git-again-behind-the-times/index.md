I really enjoy [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion) but I am frustrated seeing tools in other programming languages like metric testing ([NDepend](http://www.ndepend.com/)), code coverage ([Emma](http://emma.sourceforge.net/)), and coding standards ([Checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)). None of these tools are new. They are immensely helpful, but not really available in [CFML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion_Markup_Language). That being said, I feel ColdFusion is several years behind everyone else. Look @ the recent Hibernate [addition to ColdFusion 9](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/coldfusion/articles/coldfusion9_orm.html). [Hibernate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hibernate_%28Java%29) actually won a Jolt Award in 2005 and has been around before that but now 2009 (really maybe 2010 depending on CF9 release) ColdFusion is incorporating it. Recently there was a successful push by the ColdFusion community towards source control. It seems [SVN](</en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversion_(software)>) is now a defacto piece in most development shops. If not SVN, then some type of source control. I am hoping for a push by [RIAForge](http://riaforge.org) and other ColdFusion community leaders to use [Git](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29). For the ColdFusion project community, I see Git as a way for stale projects to get re-energized and have more community members involved. Git might have been a good fit for [Fusebox](wwhttp://www.fusebox.org/) so it didn't have to fork into a new project [FuseNG](http://cfrant.blogspot.com/2009/08/fuseng-announced.html). Users of Fusebox, could have seen the main Fusebox repository going dormant and noticed [Adam Haskell](http://cfrant.blogspot.com) with alot of activity. FuseBox users then could start pulling from Adam. Fusebox could also eventually pull in Adam's changes or not. This is just one example but I hope to see ColdFusion ride the crest of Git instead of following in the wake.
