## What is Compass

["Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is a stylesheet authoring framework that makes your stylesheets and markup easier to build and maintain. With compass, you write your stylesheets in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) instead of CSS." This screencast is very good. It is an hour long so it isn't for the faint of heart but you can watch some and resume where you left off. [Chris Eppstein](http://github.com/chriseppstein), author of Compass, is very well spoken and starts with a bang saying most css frameworks aren't really frameworks. Watch the first ten minutes and I bet you'll want to see more.
