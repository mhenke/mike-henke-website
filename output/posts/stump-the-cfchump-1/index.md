I am doing a "Stump the CFChump" series. I recently passed the [ColdFusion 9 exam](http://blogs.adobe.com/adc/2010/11/coldfusion-9-certification-exam-now-available.html) and this is material I learned while studying. I have several [CodeSchool](http://www.codeschool.com/) gift cards to giveaway so comments who answer correctly I'll email you the discount code. ["Stump the Chumps"](http://www.cartalk.com/content/stump-chumps) is from the "Car Talk" so I am spinning that title for ColdFusion. These are questions that stumped me when studying.
