With the help of Ryan Stille's, we'll be presenting Eclipse and CFEclipse for the Nebraska Coldfusion User Group on Febuary 26, 2008. More details on the [NECFUG](http://www.necfug.com/) website. It is my first presentation in a long time, so it should be fun. I have been working on the presentation using Google Docs. I first outlined it with a document then transfered information into a presentation. After we give it, I'll post my notes and the presentation slides.
