[Chris Peters](http://www.clearcrystalmedia.com/gc/), member of the [CFWheels](http://cfwheels.org) team, added a page to their site called "[Who's Using ColdFusion on Wheels](http://www.cfwheels.org/sites)". It is great to be able to see sites using ColdFusion on Wheels. I am an advocate of CFWheels because it is simple and initiative for any ColdFusion developer to quickly create a modified Model, View, and Controller (MVC) site using it. It doesn't have any cumbersome xml configuration files, listeners/events to create, or repetitive getters and setters to code. You create code like a ColdFusion developer would expect. The built in [ORM](http://www.cfwheels.org/docs/chapter/object-relational-mapping) is awesome to rapidly create mundane sql commands.
