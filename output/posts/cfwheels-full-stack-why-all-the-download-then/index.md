Wheels is mentioned as a full stack framework sometimes. What does "full stack" mean? Full stack frameworks "often gathered multiple libraries useful for [web development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development "Web development") into a single cohesive [software stack](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_stack "Software stack") for web developers to use." The quote is from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web\_application\_framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_application_framework) You can get started with Wheels without any downloads/plugins. After you get familiar with Wheels, you may want to check plugins out. Like most things with Wheels, you don't have to learn everything at once. It can be on your own time line. If Wheels is a single cohesive stack, why all the downloads/plugins? Well, as great as [the Wheels core team](http://cfwheels.org/community/core-team) is they may not have thought of everything. They may even have a different idea from what you think some Wheels function's parameters should be and what it should do. Plugins allow you, the Wheels framework user, to modify or enhance Wheels functionality. Some plugins may eventually get incoroporated in Wheels like the Flash Helper mentioned below. Some plugins may be niche like the Oracle Auto increment plugin and not necessary to be added to the framework but are useful anyways. Below is a list of some of the many plugins created by Wheels users. The full selection is here [http://cfwheels.org/plugins/](http://cfwheels.org/plugins/).
