I had an email come in and thought this would be useful for others promoting technical change. \_I'd love everyone using Eclipse so we could take advantage of Mylyn, you seem to really push its powers, however, we have some here that are very stuck in their development ways, so it might not work.

Do you have any thoughts on this?\_ I feel "have the developers use whatever editor they are most comfortable with" is best. But once they see you quickly switching between tickets, not having to remember to re-open files, having your tasks in your ide, automatically creating commit messages, etc they will be more receptive to switching and maybe even ask you to help them get setup. Once you get everything setup, buy everyone lunch and do a demo for 20 mins. Keep it short and highlight covering what you think is making you more production. I would also read [Driving Technical Change](http://www.amazon.com/Driving-Technical-Change-Terrence-Ryan/dp/1934356603) before your demo so you are ready.
