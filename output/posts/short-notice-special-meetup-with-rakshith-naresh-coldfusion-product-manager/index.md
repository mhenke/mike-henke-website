I got this email from Sandy Clark and wanted to pass it on if you are in or near the DC area. ----------- Sorry for the short notice, but we just now got things finalized.  
  
Join us at TImpano's in Rockville, MD tomorrow (3/29) at 7pm to meet with Rakshith Naresh, Adobe ColdFusion Product Manager.  He's in town for a few days and wanted to meet up with users, so we'll do what we do best, and meet him at our favorite local CF watering hole to have some drinks and appetizers and talk with him on our favorite subject.  
  
If you can, please register at [http://www.dc-coldfusion.com/index.cfm?event=meetings.showMeeting&meetingId=20](http://www.dc-coldfusion.com/index.cfm?event=meetings.showMeeting&meetingId=20) so we have an idea as to how many people will be showing up.  
  
If for some reason that doesn't work, send me an email and I'll make sure you are accounted for.

This will take the place of our regularly scheduled April Meeting.  Join us in May for a presentation by Oguz Demirkapi on Practical Security in ColdFusion.
