I was reading a [thread on CFEclipse Users](http://groups.google.com/group/cfeclipse-users/browse_thread/thread/545975ef8f0c5d7e/a99eed1ecd036ec8) and had an idea. I am going to give [Mark Drew](http://www.markdrew.co.uk/) some of my tax rebate. I guess the NPR fund raising this week has affected me. I'll try to catch him @ [CF.Objective](http://www.cfobjective.com/). Mark has done a great job with [CFEclipse](http://cfeclipse.org) and I take it for granted. CF.Objective falls pretty close to when my [rebate check should arrive](http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/17/pf/taxes/rebates_payment_schedule/). Thanks Mark!
