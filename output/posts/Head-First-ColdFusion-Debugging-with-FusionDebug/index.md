I gave my first try at a new presentation called [Head First ColdFusion Debugging with FusionDebug](http://docs.google.com/Presentation?id=dc2sb454_130dhf5fccx). From the link, you can either sign in and see some speaker notes or follow the link below the slide image to view the sides. The preso seemed to go well but I would love to give it again if any ColdFusion User groups are interested. I had a couple hiccups with my bug examples. I also have done my intro into Eclipse, CFEClipse, and Mylyn a couple times @ barcamps and the NECFUG if any group is interested.
