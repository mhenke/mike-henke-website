Quick Eclipse and CFEclipse hint. The entry is mainly about _turning on CFEclipse line numbers_ but _useful for other hidden Eclipse preferences._ In Eclipse, under **Windows --> Preferences** are many settings its hard to locate the one you are looking for. Eclipse actually has a built in search/filter. In my screenshot I start typing in "numbers" since I am looking for turning on line numbers. I could look for font, startup, etc. All the preferences filter so only matching settings are left. ![](images/GenEditor.jpg) You might think you have turned on Line numbers for CFEclipse but actually it is for Eclipse. You will need to switch on _a line number setting specific for CFEclipse_. This setting actually doesn't work for the filter but my last screen shot shows were it is located. Restart any open CFEclipse files and now the line numbers should appear. ![CFEclipse Line Number setting](images/CFEclipsePref.jpg)
