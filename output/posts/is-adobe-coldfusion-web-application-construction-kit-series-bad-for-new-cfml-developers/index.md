I remember when I started programming [ColdFusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ColdFusion) fresh out of college in 1999. I had a 3 day HTML class which was my first exposure to HTML, then read books. I would "buy" the Dummy series, then exchange the unmarked book for a more advanced book on the same subject covering ColdFusion, SQL, and HTML. The [Adobe ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Adobe-ColdFusion-Web-Application-Construction/dp/032166034X) (CFWACK) book was my bible along with a ColdFusion video series. Flash forward to today, would I recommend a new developer learn ColdFusion with the CFWACK book. No, the content has been updated for ColdFusion releases but the methodology has not. It seems to still teach on a procedural methodology not Object Oriented approach. Is Adobe ColdFusion Web Application Construction Kit series bad for new CFML developers? Yes, it teaches how to create a mess with unmaintainable code **_UPDATE 2: And ugly code (see comments below about using script)._** We aren't developing one off web pages anymore but complex web applications. Even though the title says "web applications" the book misses this point. On Amazon, I looked inside Vol 1 and the first CFML code the reader is exposed to is one template with a query, html, cfoutput in "Introducting ColdFusion". _I am guessing_ Chapter 11: Creating Data-Driven Pages and Chapter 14: Using Forms to Add or Change Data are the same procedural mess with the dreaded display/action page methodology. It appears the first mention of ColdFusion Components (CFC) is Part 5, Chapter 24. **_UPDATE 1: I had searched v2, not v1. It appears the first mention of ColdFusion Components (CFC) is in Chapter 11 "The Basics of Structured Development"._** Also CFWACK series is huge, Vol 1 is 600 pages, Vol 2 is 600 pages, and Vol 3 is 640 pages. This being said, I would recommend several ColdFusion books for new CFML developers.
