I came across an _ACTIVELY_ developed ColdFusion Unit Testing Framework a couple weeks ago. [MXUnit](http://mxunit.org/) seems really well thought out and the guys behind it are really working hard on it. If you aren't fully invested in CFUnit or CFCUnit, it is worth checking out. MXUnit even has a working and easy to setup Eclipse plugin. The MXUnit team is presenting a 2 hour workshop @ [WebManiacs Conference](http://www.webmaniacsconference.com) in Washington, DC, May 19-23 2008. Finally, a [MXUnit google group](http://groups.google.com/group/mxunit) is setup for questions/comments on MXUnit.
