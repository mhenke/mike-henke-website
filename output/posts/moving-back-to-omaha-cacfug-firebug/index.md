Well, if you follow my blog you may remember I [moved to Washington, DC](http://mikehenke.com/dc-or-bust) nearly 2 years ago. It has been an interesting time. I have seen [many embassies](http://www.thingstododc.com/), been on lots of [walking tours](http://www.washingtonwalks.com), and many boat cruises on the Potomac along with seeing all the memorials and some Smithsonians. I really enjoyed the [Southeast Minnesota Honor flights](http://www.semnhonorflight.org/). I think I helped with five. With that said, I am moving back to Omaha after accepting a position that looks very interesting and will allow me to mentor a younger developer while hopefully implementing a lot of [Wheels projects](http://www.cfwheels.org) on new applications while expanding the position and leading more developers as the company grows.

## CACFUG

I would like to point out a new user group, I will be missing. The [Capital Area ColdFusion User Group](http://www.dc-coldfusion.com/) has had an outstanding start and I am sad I will be unable to attend all the upcoming meetings. They have a lot of great content and presenters to pick from in the DMV (District, Maryland, and Virgina -- Washington loves its initializations). The CACFUG reminded me of the [NECFUG](http://www.necfug.com/) I left and will be rejoining in Omaha. The members are really friendly and smart. The upcoming meeting on Nov 9th will be my last for the CACFUG.

## Firebug/CSS

The job I am leaving asked me to give a quick Firebug/CSS demo before I leave, so here are some resources. I would watch this for an [intro into firebug](http://getfirebug.com/video/Intro2FB.mp4). I use the net and html tabs the most for css/html editing/debugging. I have used the Script tab a little to debug javascript. As for learning CSS, I would say I learned a lot from this book, [Head First XHTML/CSS](http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-HTML-CSS-XHTML/dp/059610197X). And for [jQuery I like the “In Action” book series](http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Action-Second-Bear-Bibeault/dp/1935182323)
