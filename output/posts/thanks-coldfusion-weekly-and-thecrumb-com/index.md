I would like to thank [ColdFusion Weekly](http://coldfusionweekly.com/) and Jim Priest @ [thecrumb.com](http://www.thecrumb.com/) for being kind enough to mention me and link to a couple of my entries. [Selenium Wiki](http://www.thecrumb.com/wiki/Selenium) - starting to build resources geared toward ColdFusion but not a requirement.
