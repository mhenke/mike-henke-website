I installed [CrossOver](http://www.codeweavers.com/products/crossover/) to test it on Ubuntu but the uninstall link from the menu didn't work. I had to go to **_/opt/cxoffice/bin/_** then run:Â **_sudo ./cxuninstall_** _mhenke@mhenke-Studio-1737:/opt/cxoffice/bin$ sudo ./cxuninsta_ll And it is gone!
