email content from Sandy Clark about upcoming user group meeting. -------- We have a special rockstar guest coming into talk to us this month.  
  
Ray Camden the CFJedi himself will be speaking on **Practices of a Modern Developer  
  
**Everyone knows what good developers do, but it isn't always obvious why. In this session, Raymond Camden will talk about the practices that are considered best practice (source control, unit testing, load testing, etc) and more importantly, why they are considered best practice. Practical examples of the benefits of these practices will be provided.
